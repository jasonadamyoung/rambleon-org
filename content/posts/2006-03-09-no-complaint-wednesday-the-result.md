Yeah, so I failed.

But a cyrusdb error on a mailbox that won’t go away until you finally do a drastic rebuild of the entire imapdb, whilst having your mail server firewalled off to only your box so you can start and restart it with impunity without worrying about new smtp deliveries or imap connections from all over the place, at the same time having your project director get a tad confused about whether the server is actually up or not due to the fact that OSX mail.app does have a rather nice offline email cache….

well &#8211; that will kill your complaint embargo each and every time.

we’ll try this again tomorrow…
