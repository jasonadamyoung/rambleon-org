One of my former staff members in Engineering now has the job as Systems Manager over there. Heâ€™s continuing in the fine tradition of posting activity notes on the ITECS Systems site &#8211; including the comment from his past week in ITECS: [Holy piles of crap, Batman! Thatâ€™s alot of meetings.][1]

During the same week &#8211; I had: 0 meetings.

zero meetings turns out to be worth even [pam configuration problems at 12:30 in the morning][2] ðŸ™‚

(actually going from delegating to doing again has been an interesting experience and worthy of another set of reflections sometime soon)
