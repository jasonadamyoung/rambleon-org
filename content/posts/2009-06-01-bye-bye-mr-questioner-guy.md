 ![noquestions][1]I so wish I had some modicum of musical talent. I think that the last time I was exposed to any kind of music education was 1st grade, maybe kindergarten. While I’m not completely tone deaf, I only rarely experience that feeling of matching the human voice to some kind of external sound, and I can’t make my voice do it. I don’t really have the readily apparent motor skills to play the guitar or the piano.

But I do so wish I had some musical talent, because I’d spend my life doing whatever I could to be the next Weird Al. Or Flight of the Conchords. Writing parody songs for the rest of my living years.

For those that know me, [asking questions][2] is fundamentally core to how I work and how I live &#8211; particularly [why?][3] &#8211; I even [joked last week][4] that my name should be legally changed to an [interrobang][5].

But sometimes the working life conspires in such a way that you have to change directions. Even for those that know me, you might be surprised that I expend the vast majority of my questioning energies on myself. That won’t and can’t change. I couldn’t turn that off if I wanted. But maybe for a time, I can stop the external questions.

You might think, ok, well that opening was certainly random. Well, I spent part of the weekend replaying Don McLean’s “American Pie” in my head in an attempt to parody the lyrics in the form “Bye, Bye, Mr. Questioner Guy” I didn’t get very far, it probably should be crowd-sourced.

So instead, I leave you with something far more entertaining. Years ago I once went to my local Kroger, only to find that they had moved the Little Debbie rack somewhere I couldn’t find it anymore. And well, the rest is history.

**Bye, Bye, Oatmeal Creme Pie**

A long, long time ago… I can still remember how
That creme filling would make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance,
That I’d never go to the south of france
If it meant I’d be without them a while
But that April day made me shiver,
Almost tempted to cry a river
Bad news at the kroger…
I don’t know I can go there

I can’t remember if I tried
My indignation that day to hide
But hunger rumbled down deep inside,
The day I found no pies.

Soo..Bye, bye Oatmeal Creme Pies
Drove my Ford to that store but the shelves was dry
And good ol’ boys were having RC and moon pie
Singing this will be the day that I die
all gone are the Oatmeal Creme Pie
