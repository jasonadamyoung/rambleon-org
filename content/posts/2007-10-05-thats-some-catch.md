[Mark is right of course][1]

> My current theory is that it’s some twisted form of wish fulfillment. “I wish this company understood the value of openness, but they don’t, so I’m going to keep buying their closed, crippled shit until they get it.” Yeah, let me know how that works out for you. And while you were waiting breathlessly for them to “get it,” Apple [locked out third-party videos][2]. And [third-party hardware][3]. And [third-party ringtones, applications, and carriers][4]. ProsperityOpenness is just around the corner!

And it’s so incredibly frustrating. [Because Apple Engineers design things like capslock key delays][5].

Don’t worry, I’ll write incredibly whiny posts when the content control dives into the desktop OS. [I have the guidebook][6]
