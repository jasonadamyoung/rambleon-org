So in a following from [last week][1]. I posted the [answers][2] and the [scoring guide][3] to the [Email Header Quiz][4].

I was pleasantly pleased with the results. And I hope people found it useful, and more that they learned from it. I think out of everything, that’s my greatest passion and desire in my job: make a difference by providing educational opportunities for people. That is harder to do at a University than one would think. It’s certainly harder in staff and IT positions than it should be.
