This week, a colleague from Auburn, and [a colleague from Iowa State][1] twittered our mini list of Geek versions of Meat Loaf songs, starting with [“2 out of 3 can’t be accurately represented in binary — but close enough ain’t bad”][2] and followed by:

  * “Paradise by the LCD backlight”
  * “NAT out of Hell” (_like a NAT out of hell… you’ll be gone when I go to logon_)
  * “Skype is a Lemon and I want my money back” (a little Alanis irony that one)
  * “For Crying Outloud [Groupwise], You Know I Hate You” (an Auburn favorite)
  * “I’d do anything for my email (but I won’t do that)”
  * “You took the urls right out of my tweet”

This is why I twitter. [are you twittering?][3] you should be.
