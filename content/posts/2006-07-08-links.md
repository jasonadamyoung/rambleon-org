Hey look &#8211; it‚Äôs a link blog entry! üôÇ

  * [Real Men of Genius &#8211; blogger person style][1] I love a good parody. (via [Jeremy Zawodny][2] * [Saturday in the Park in Beloit][3] _On July 1st, the community of Beloit, Wisconsin came together on the banks of the Rock River to recreate George Seurat‚Äôs ‚ÄúSunday Afternoon on the Island of LaGrande Jatte‚Äù ‚Äì ‚ÄúSaturday in the Park with Friends‚Äù_ Cool! * [Social Networking Essays linked by Guy Kawasaki][4]. From a quote in one of the links &#8211; [an essay by Fred Stutzman at UNC-CH][5] _There‚Äôs gold in them hills, people. Now go get it._ In related news, I‚Äôm looking forward to making some time to install [Lyceum][6]. (Kawasaki link via [Chuq][7]) * [MySQL Performance blog][8]. I need to spend some serious time just learning a modicum of things about tweaking our MySQL performance. (Also via [Chuq][9]). * [Top 50 Scientist Blogs][10] (via [Steve Rubel][11] via [Chuq][12]). This is exactly why we need Extension Specialist and Agent blogs (likely via [Lyceum][6]) We just have to figure out our internal battles about common look and feel and branding vs. letting our users have some freedom of expression. * [Data Leakage and crappy tele-apps from Sprint][13]. Sigh. * [Damn Interesting][14]. WHAT A GREAT BLOG! This is what keeping up with too much information is about. Damn Interesting indeed. * [LiveJournal does Jabber][15]. (via [Peter][16]. It‚Äôs happening folks!. After the server transitions are done. I‚Äôm spending serious quality time with XMPP and our [Extension System Chat Server][17]. * [Yet another reason to license that software][18] _Looks like that logo flashes when you author using a trial version of Apple‚Äôs Shake. So basically from what we can ascertain, Sony (or its ad agency) is too cheap to buy their people the full version of Shake, which goes for $500 list on Apple‚Äôs site. Tisk, tisk!_ Bwahahahahahahahaha.
