Why did you make it a pain to install X11.app? You don’t include it already installed in a default distribution of Tiger for those that get new Macs. And by the time that a student or a co-worker realizes that they need it, they aren’t going to have their install CD’s with them to go run the Optional Installs package off the install CD.

Please to make X11 downloadable again.

Thanks.
