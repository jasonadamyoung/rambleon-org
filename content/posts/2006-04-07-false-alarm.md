So we just got all excited.

A tractor trailer showed up at the loading dock.

We thought it was the APC UPS’s we’ve been waiting close to 2 months to get through the purchasing/ordering process.

Nope.

It was a shipment of hula hoops. For some camp (probably 4-H).

False Alarm. We return you to your regularly scheduled blog reading.
