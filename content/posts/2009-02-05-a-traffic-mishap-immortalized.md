I noticed this a while back, but wanted to blog it now that I was checking out the new version of [Google Earth][1]

I’m pretty fascinated by photography. How it enables you to freeze for all time a span of time — in this case 1/1600th of a second.

So what does this have to do with Google Earth? Well, it’s an interesting world in which we live in this new information era.

Maybe for example, you are flying around in Earth, checking out your work building and you see something “different”

So you zoom in.

And realize that a traffic mishap is immortalized for a time — or at least until Google gets new aerials.

It is kind of a frustrating intersection, as the [street view bears out][5]

Interesting world it is, isn’t it?
