So I had this long, ginormous post series planned about a service transition last week — where I had to move the mail server from one room to another to preempt a 57 hour outage. It was going to full of all kinds of fun tidbits about sheer panic with Apple’s OpenDirectory — and Apple Server Hardware, and making sure your eth0 and eth1 aren’t hard-bound to the wrong mac addresses on your Dells — and all kinds of things like that.

However, all I ended up doing was making bad jokes about being bitter — and well, it was boring me — and I was writing it.

So anyway — having already experienced this prior to now with my bad attempts at a pseudo-web comic. It’s clear that what can be said in multi-thousands of words [can really just be said in 4 frames. With stick figures][1]
