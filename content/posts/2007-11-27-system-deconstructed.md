So I had this long, ginormous post series planned about a service transition last week &#8211; where I had to move the mail server from one room to another to preempt a 57 hour outage. It was going to full of all kinds of fun tidbits about sheer panic with Apple’s OpenDirectory &#8211; and Apple Server Hardware, and making sure your eth0 and eth1 aren’t hard-bound to the wrong mac addresses on your Dells &#8211; and all kinds of things like that.

However, all I ended up doing was making bad jokes about being bitter &#8211; and well, it was boring me &#8211; and I was writing it.

So anyway &#8211; having already experienced this prior to now with my bad attempts at a pseudo-web comic. It’s clear that what can be said in multi-thousands of words [can really just be said in 4 frames. With stick figures][1]
