I don’t really make New Year’s Resolutions, and haven’t really this year either other than following on from [my last post][1] about finding to reduce self-induced work-related stress. I do have some amorphous and not-so-amorphous goals for the year. Most of which I’ll keep to myself, something that was influenced by [this talk from Derek Sivers last year][2] (btw, not because I think he’s right, I actually think he’s wrong about the psychology, but just because I think at this time, it’s right for me).

I’ll share one though, my goal is to try to keep laughing, and making myself laugh. I decided the other day it might be cool to try to make a marginally funny [someecard][3] most every day, I figured it would be fun, and it keeps me thinking. I’ve [done a few so far][4] — and “marginal” is key, but it makes me laugh, and that’s all I wanted.

I figured — or I hoped — I might come up with one good enough to make Editor’s choice, and that was a personal goal. Well, I got lucky enough to do that with this one:

[![someecards.com - The meetings will continue until morale improves.][5]][6]

It’s been a ton of fun looking around at twitter at it being retweeted and seeing that it gets sent, and hope it’s making somebody laugh. I figure 2011 is all downhill from here now. But I guess the goal now is to do it again.

So in the immortal words of Ernie Banks, “Let’s play two!”
