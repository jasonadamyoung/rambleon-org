By far, one of the more interesting [engineering failures][1] is that of the [Tacoma-Narrows bridge collapse][2] (of which Iâ€™ve [pointed out before in a rambly treatise about IT as an engineering discipline][3]

Anyway, the collapse is the subject of the [latest _Damn Interesting_ post][4]. Highly recommended damn interesting reading.
