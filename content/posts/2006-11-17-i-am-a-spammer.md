I just had to send 3,351 emails to our registered users list.

Ruby and Rails made this remarkably easy, and thatâ€™s really scary.

It took 3 hours for my email server to breathe again. I had to process about 3% of the emails as bounces, which generated another 2 mails per bounce from our support tool.

I feel so dirty.
