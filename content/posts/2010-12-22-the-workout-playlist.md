I totally need some new workout music (yes, yes, I know, it should be “workout” &#8211; but I do own an elliptical that’s not a clothes rack) &#8211; so I’m turning to all 6.5 of my estimated blog readers for help.

So here’s my current list:

“Superman”Five for Fighting

“When You’re On Top”The Wallﬂowers

“Gonna Make You Sweat”C+C Music Factory

“Lose Yourself “Eminem

“No Such Thing”John Mayer

“F**k Was I (Morgan Page Remix)”Jenny Owen Youngs

“Hot In Herre”Jenny Owen Youngs

“Not Ready To Make Nice”Dixie Chicks

“In the End”Linkin Park

“Eye Of The Tiger”Survivor

“Fuego”Bomba Estéreo

“Starry Eyed Surprise”Paul Oakenfold

> Basically, it’s music that I already had that I thought would be good to workout to, and that I could handle (usually) listening to it over and over, e.g. I’d have more “Rocky” music, but other than “Eye of the Tiger” &#8211; I can’t listen to it more than once a year or so.

> Out of the whole list, I replay “Lose Yourself “ and “Not Ready To Make Nice” over and over, often more than once in a 30 minute session. Those probably represent the core motivational themes of what makes good workout music for me, angry songs about personal drivetaking a stand/taking on the world. I would totally dig recommendations along that line.

So what’s on your workout list?
