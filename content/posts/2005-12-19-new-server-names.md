I’m not your typical systems geek. Most system geeks name their servers after typical geek things — science fiction, medieval characters, the simpsons. I even had some colleagues do “Ren and Stimpy” one time.

Me, I have gone with baseball names.

So far, I’ve named systems after Lou Gehrig, Jackie Robinson, Stan Musial, Casey Stengel, Bill Veeck, storage units after the Polo Grounds and Ebbets Field, and two student use workstations named after local-area minor league ballparks.

My two new servers are named after Roy Campanella and Roberto Clemente.

Not a bad all-star team if I do say so myself.
