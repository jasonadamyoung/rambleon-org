So, I try to keep my politics checked at the door, because well, I don’t really have all that much passion about it. Like [this post][1] by Dilbert author Scott Adams &#8211; and extending it to political pundits &#8211; most experts and pundits all have some kind of personally-colored glasses they see everything through.

Because, technology is more fun.

But pardon me while I get political for a moment, because what I can’t stand is corporate bullying &#8211; especially technology companies putting out [crappy products][2] &#8211; perhaps even criminally corrupt crappy products &#8211; and hiding behind [threats and lawsuits][3]. (Diebold anyone?).

So [so long diebold][4] &#8211; I **really** hope the door smacks in your keyster as you go out the door.
