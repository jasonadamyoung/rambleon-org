I was trying to search Lexis/Nexis for a court case involving a relative for another relativeâ€¦ and I saw the funniest record of the week:

> UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, Plaintiff, v. NINETY-SIX THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($ 96,100.00) IN UNITED STATES CURRENCY, Defen-dant.

No. 06-2370-B

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TENNESSEE, WESTERN DIVISION

2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15111

March 2, 2007, Decided March 2, 2007, Filed

Only in America would there be a court filing against money.
