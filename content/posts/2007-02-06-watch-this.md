I started to title this “The Web Killed My Video Star” or “I Don’t Like Video, (Tell Me Why)” &#8211; both of which are highly relevant pop culture references, but they are terrible titles for the subject matter.

I haven’t watched a full-length show on TV in quite some time without time-shifting, or interrupting, or browsing the internet at the same time (which because I can’t process multiple input streams at one time effectively(1) means I completely ignore the television)

I just watched [this video (YouTube)][1] from the [Digital Ethnography group at Kansas State][2]

You should [watch it too][1]

This well might be the only video that I’ve **ever** watched on YouTube where I watched the whole thing.

I’m not so sure about the entire list presented at the end. But a little rethinking is certainly in order.

Way to go fellow Land-Granters!

(1) so maybe I can’t multitask, but I have an extremely efficient context switch
