Yes, Iâ€™m really at the University of Florida: large campus (at least for the NC State grad)

I really liked the lake in the middle of campus. And what I guess is spanish moss everywhere:

The lake is a wildlife preserve. I saw an egret or two, a great blue heron, a hawk, and yes, even the reason that the schoolâ€™s mascot is named for what it is named (not the best picture, but itâ€™s hard to shoot alligators with a handheld camera ðŸ˜‰ )
