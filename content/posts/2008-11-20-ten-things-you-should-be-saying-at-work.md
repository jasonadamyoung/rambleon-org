Earlier this week [James shared][1] this [article from publishing CEO Michael Hyatt][2] about the “10 things you’d love to say at work but can’t”

But you know, in my job, I find it more prevalent that there’s an awful lot of things at work that we should be saying — but don’t. And I don’t mean those “I love the work you do” express-the-unspoken-gratitude-and-appreciation-for-your-colleagues-more-than-you-do things . I mean, real, legitimate definitive discourse about things we do, and the things we don’t do.

Here are some of mine — and as you might imagine [if you have perused prior postings heretofore][3] mine come mainly the the form of questions.

  1. Who, exactly, is “they”?
  2. <table>
      <tr>
        <td>
          What do you think [word
        </td>
        
        <td>
          phrase] means in this situation?
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

  3. What data do we have that backs up that assertion?
  4. Thanks for that data, can you tell me how it was generated?
  5. How does this help us get to where we want to be?
  6. I don’t think that this has worked like we thought it would. Let’s try something different.
  7. I don’t know.
  8. Yes.
  9. No.
 10. Why?

That’s my 10 off the top — what are yours?
