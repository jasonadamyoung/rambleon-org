Iâ€™m sure Apple absolutely loves this pressâ€¦

so just for the record, because most people donâ€™t really know how to read/take what I write or say when Iâ€™m in tongue-in-cheek mode (as evidenced in the past with interacting with folks on campus):

Oh, just in case &#8211; because I got in trouble for this before ðŸ™‚

My last note was a terribly tongue-in-cheek response (except for the whole IE and Dante part :-p) about the whole boot camp thing. Dual-boot is overrated, I think, because one side or the other DOES most often get neglected &#8211; but for those with intel macs it might be cool and actually work well for you &#8211; so try it out! Let the PackMUG know how it goes!
