While trying to run Windows update with my VMWare Fusion-based XP install:

![Script Error coming from Microsoft Update][1]

And when running the debugger:

![The line the script debugger took me to.][2]

I’m sure it might possibly be something I’ve done to it, either with the Script Debugger install from Office Two-thousand-whatever-it-is or something else. I just find it a bit humorous.
