I could be an App Store moderator too. [via John Gruber @ Daring Fireball][1]

> You can’t make this stuff up. Apple has rejected the latest version of Tweetie — currently the most popular Twitter client in the App Store — because there’s a swear word in the current list of top Twitter trends. The trends feature isn’t new to this version of Tweetie, nor is Tweetie the only iPhone Twitter client that has the feature. It’s just that there happens to be a dirty word in the trend list now.

I can only figure that this moderator or moderators in the App Store division have some kind of dirt on Steve Jobs. Or maybe they ran Merrill Lynch in a former life.
