To be titled “Rambles of an University System Administrator” — my professional blog sure has suffered from a dearth of system administration topics.

Well, no more.

[eXtension][1] finally has some server equipment — and after a few days of crawling around on my hands and knees racking it all up, I have several observations coming. Now I realize that it’s somewhat bad form to just stick a post here to say what I’m going to say. But that’s what I’m saying.

Meanwhile, here — [remember back to “Here comes the Hotstepper”][2] and get it stuck in your head while you wait 🙂

_Hit It! Nah, na na na nah, na na na nah, na na nah, na na nah, na na na nah

Here comes the sysadmin, configure-er I’m the macintosh gangster, configure-er Pick up the news in-a de ‘gator, configure-er Still love that rss, configure-er

No no blogs don’t die Yes they mul-ti-ply Unit test we’ll hear argument sing Act like you know Scoble I don’t know what Google don’t know Touch Apache up and go, uh-oh! Ch-ch-change change logs_

Okay, it needs some work — but it’s not bad for five minutes of work.

(yes, I know I said _professional_ blog earlier, but it’s all relative)
