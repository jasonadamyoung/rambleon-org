So for the bit of backstory on this. I was feeling, for a few hours, pretty rebellious over deploying some changes I had some concerns with that included a link to our terms of use, and over other not entirely related things that are certainly neither here nor there. And when my colleague checked the changes in all the applications, and asked us to tag and deploy said apps — well, when the rebellion turns passive-aggressive, the rebellious turn to [Hamlet][1]. Apologies to Willie. Heck, apologies to the entire United Kingdom.

> _Deploy or not deploy:_ _that is the question:
  
> Whether it is nobler in the mind to suffer
  
> The slings and arrows of continued slight
  
> Or to refuse to give to requests of little import
  
> And by opposing end them?
  
> To tag: to launch: Display;
  
> and by a launch to say we end
  
> The down-loads by the thousands uninformed that users are heir to, it is a consumption Devoutly to be wished.
  
> To tag, to launch: To launch: perchance to dream: ay, there’s the rub; For in that launch of tag what dreams may come
  
> When we have shuffled off this asked request
  
> Must give us pause: there’s the disrespect
  
> That makes calamity of so long hours
  
> For who would bear the whips and scorns of terms,
  
> The oppressor’s restriction, the expert’s contumely,
  
> The pangs of unanswered question, the moderator’s delays,
  
> The insolence of responsiveness and the spurns
  
> That patient merit of the unworthy takes
  
> When they themselves might conform to terms
  
> With a bare contribution? who would questions bear, to grunt and sweat under a weary app,
  
> But that the dread of something said after launch,
  
> That undiscovered interface from whose testing
  
> No one has done, puzzles the will
  
> And makes us rather bear the apps we have
  
> Than to let fly the checkins we know not of?
  
> Thus complaints does make cowards of us all;
  
> And thus the native prompt of terminal
  
> Is typed over with the null casts of thought,
  
> And enterprises of great waste and questionable humor
  
> With this regard our time has turned awry,
  
> And we’ve lost that desire of action,
  
> Soft you now!
  
> The fair Engineering! in thy meeting preambles
  
> Be all my long ramblings remembered._

My passive aggressive rebellion was obsessive, but you have to allow that it was borderline creative 😉

p.s. And yes the end result was “To deploy”

p.p.s. To wit, my colleague responded in haiku

> _clear notice of terms
  
> painfully absent from view
  
> type cap deploy please_
