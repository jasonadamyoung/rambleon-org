I just ran the original software restore on my wife’s old Snow iMac, prepping it to give it away (yes, it’s getting upgraded to at least 10.3 😉 )

It booted from restore in OS 9 by default, and the registration was great — the line of the day was during the network connection dialog, one of the options was:

“I am not ready for the Internet right now”

Some days, me neither little iMac. Me neither.
