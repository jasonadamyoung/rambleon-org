Steven Frank gets the [quote of the day][1]

> People don’t want FEATURES. They’ll tell you they do until they’re blue in the face. But what they actually want is ease-of-use, and solutions to real-world problems

Bonus quote:

> A 34-company committee couldn’t create a successful ham sandwich, much less a mobile application suite. It’s going to be some half-baked turd

It’s about the GPhone, nee “Android” — but the quotes are highly relevant to all kinds of engineering design of both software and hardware.

[p.s. I’m not echoing this because I think it might be true about Android. I don’t know what to think about Android. But the quotes in the context of creating software products are absolutely correct]
