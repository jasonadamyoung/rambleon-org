A few weeks ago [I mentioned that I was revamping my lens lineup][1]. This is probably my next experimental evolution with photography &#8211; which for better or worse consists mostly of pictures of [these two jokers][2].

My first DSLR lens was the [Nikon 18-200][3]. Itâ€™s a really great travel lens, itâ€™s hard to beat the range. Over time though, I tired a bit of the lens creeping (which should be mitigated with the second generation of it) &#8211; and I guess I was a little bit spoiled with my third lens purchase, the [Tokina 100mm Macro][4] &#8211; which at 150mm effective and fast enough to get the dogs running around the yard, has become more of a portrait lens than a macro lens for me.

It may be still my favorite. Giving me pictures like this:

_and_ this:

And after completely data-geeking out on [running exiftool][7] against all my 18-200 lens photos and realizing that almost 50% of all the pictures I took with it were at 18 or 200 &#8211; I decided Iâ€™d be well served going Wide. And Long. And trading in the one to broaden my horizons a bit.

So I went with the [Nikon 10-24mm][8] on the Wide end.

And the [Nikon 70-300mm (VR)][10] on the long

And even with quite the dance of lens-changing on the trails &#8211; I havenâ€™t had that much fun with my camera in quite some time. I couldnâ€™t be more pleased with both &#8211; especially on my first outing with them, a trip my wife and I took to the mountains on the NC/VA border:

All three (the two lenses and the Mountain Vacation ðŸ™‚ ) are highly recommended.
