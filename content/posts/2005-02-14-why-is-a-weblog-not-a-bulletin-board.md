I thought it ironic that the subject question [popped up on another .edu weblog][1] just a few short days after I was exchanging an opinion on the matter with an NCSU colleague.

I like their quoted answer better, but here was mine:

<div class="highlighter-rouge">
  <pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; That's an interesting question.  I haven't really stopped to think about it &gt;     much until framing something to respond with.   &gt;        &gt;     Weblogs are an extension of the personal webpage, usually presented using &gt;     some technology tool or system that makes it a little easier to keep &gt;     updated - and the most common way of publishing and receiving updated data &gt;     is time-based - which is why they end often being like a diary/journal - &gt;     though I have seen essay sites that are like blogs, but the author(s) go &gt;     back and edit previously published content, either to keep it updated or in &gt;     a kind of "revisionist history" mode.  The Weblog is usually all about the &gt;     author of the site and their personality/experience.  Or in cases where &gt;     there is a shared or community blog, it becomes like a recurring &gt;     newsletter/news site/magazine of sorts, governed again by the personalities &gt;     of the publishers (which is why many in the so-called "blogosphere" are &gt;     pushing the idea of blogs as new-media/new journalism).  In a way, there &gt;     have been some powerful journalistic-esque things that have resulted. &gt;     Individuals theoretically inside IRAQ blogging as the war started, Chinese &gt;     bloggers writing clandestine accounts of life inside China, very Anne &gt;     Frank, though now published immediately.  Voices are coming out of &gt;     corporate entities, creating either a perception of accessible &gt;     organizations (or ones having problems, which is getting some of the &gt;     bloggers fired).   &gt;        &gt;     Blogs, like personal homepages, usually have a custom look and feel when &gt;     you visit the site, and usually a unique voice of the individual writing &gt;     the content for the site.   &gt;        &gt;     While many do have comments, and the comment threads on high-traffic blogs &gt;     do become very similar to a bulletin board - a virtual, but fixed space &gt;     where people congregate in discussion, there's usually not much of a &gt;     conversation happening at the site of the blog.  Instead there's more of a &gt;     reference model of individual sites linking to another site - very much &gt;     like a continuously updated personal web page.  Collection sites (like &gt;     http://www.technorati.com/ have sprung up, providing an aggregated view &gt;     of the content, links, subjects of the weblogs, which tends to highlight &gt;     pop subjects among the blogs informing those collection sites of updates. &gt;     But those collection sites don't really have discussion on the pop subject, &gt;     more they act as clearinghouses to find subjects that are being discussed &gt;     by the individuals).   &gt;        &gt;     Writers of blogs tend to expound more than bulletin boards (e.g. TheWolfWeb &gt;     [ed. a student-run bulletin board off campus], which I think is an &gt;     example of the traditional bulletin board, where most of the threads &gt;     consist of one-two sentences comments or provocations ;-) or responses &gt;     to such) blog entries are usually longer.</code></pre>
