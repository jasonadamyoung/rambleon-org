Well, I remember reading all the recent hype about the bike locks you could defeat with a ballpoint pen.

Iâ€™m just catching up with news this afternoon &#8211; because apparently the [laptop locks are easily defeated too][1] (via [engadet][2]).

I just proved this by ruining the little Fellowes barrel-lock thing I bought for my office at work (and successfully unlocking the lock in about 5 seconds).

Hooray for technology.
