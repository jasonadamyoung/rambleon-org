Today is officially “no complaint wednesday” — my attempt to go throughout the entire workday and not complain about anything.

To date, this is has been basically impossible for me.

But I believe in the impossible.

Jason Young, making the impossible possible since, oh, about 6:50am this morning 🙂 (this post written at 7:30am 😉 )
