So I have way too many IT and Computing syndication feeds filling up my newsreader and not enough photography-oriented ones.

However, I’ve seen a paucity of photography-oriented sites with syndication feeds (most of them seem to prefer to lock up most of their content in forums without feeds) but I think I’m just looking in the wrong places.

So can anyone suggest good photography-oriented blogs or bloggers or sites with feeds?

Here’s the list that’s currently in my photography folder (er, photography tag) in Google Reader:

  * The feed for [dpblogs.com][1]
  * The feed for [dpreview.com][2]
  * The feed for [The Flickr blog][3] (I also have a number of group pools in my feeds)
  * The feed for [Chuq Von Rospach’s Imaging Reality blog][4]
  * A feed of sorts for [kenrockwell.com][5] (“of sorts” is because I haven’t quite figured out how he ties it to site content, it’s a third-party service that looks to be manually updated)
  * The feed for [Rob Galbraith’s site][6] that seems mostly a feed for vendor announcements

Clearly, I need better ones (Chuq’s site and the dpblogs.com site are the only things I’d really call a photography blog out of that list).
