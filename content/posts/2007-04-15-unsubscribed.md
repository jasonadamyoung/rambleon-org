I really like the content for the about.com photography blog.

However, I’m really annoyed by the fact that they don’t have full feeds.

Actually, I _might_ could handle the lack of full feeds (I do handle this for [arstechnica][1]) when the content is good enough to click through from the teaser. However, about.com’s links take me to a fairly hefty ad-laden page — and it generates the firefox pop-up warning every time. I’ve seen sites with far worse ads — but it’s actually as hard when you land at about.com to tell the difference between the content of the article and all the junk surrounding it at initial glance as any other site on the net. I’ve always avoided all about.com results in Google for this very reason.

It’s a shame too, because the photography content is/was good.

But I just can’t deal with it anymore — I unsubscribed from the blog.

Good content ruined by partial feeds and an all-out extraneous advertisement and poor design assault just isn’t worth reading.
