It might be nice to move there.

The British Educational Communications and Technology Agency recently [released a report][1] that concludes, among other things:

> Pupils, teachers and parents should also be made aware of the wide range of free-to-use products currently available and on how to use and access them.

That’s pretty inspiring actually. I’d hope that we could do that here in the U.S. but I don’t have much hope that we ever will.

We are too busy educating our populace to grow up and [detain 5 year olds as terrorist suspects and separating them from their mothers][2]

My wife and brother-in-law are right, common sense isn’t so common anymore.

Hooray for the Brits.
