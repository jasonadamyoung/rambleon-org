Hey, is this thing on?

Tomorrow is the summer solstice, and in the [four years since I merged blogs and brought back "rambleon.org"](https://rambleon.org/2017/06/22/summer-solstice/) - those years here have still been [demonstrably rambly](https://rambleon.org/2019/10/09/kuberneetus-kuberneetus-kuberneetus/), but there's been a relative [dearth of rambles](https://rambleon.org/posts/).

I guess that's fairly apt for life over the last four years as well. Two job changes, a pandemic, a marriage (in the pandemic!) - have brought change and stagnation both.  

[Truman is no longer with me](https://rambleon.org/2021/03/22/he-changed-mine/) and [Winston is gone too](https://rambleon.org/2021/04/22/my-little-symphony/) and here I am on the brink of summer solstice, after a reflective week away [from work](https://gitlab.com/jayo) fixing my atom feeds and redirection (if you see this in your reader - Hi!) that broke in my wordpress-to-octopress-to-jekyll-to-wordpress-to-hugo transition along the way, and finding the desire to ramble again.  

For the curious, [this blog is still a 10x blog](https://rambleon.org/2019/08/18/this-blog-is-now-a-10x-blog/) - costing infinitely times more than it should by running in an nginx container in a k3s-based Kubernetes Cluster on a single VPS in Digital Ocean, along with my [hobby rails app](https://gitlab.com/rambleon/busterleague).  Commits to the [source](https://gitlab.com/rambleon/rambleon-org) auto-deploy to the cluster using GitLab CI/CD and the [GitLab Kubernetes Agent](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/) - because well, as a Professional Yak Shaver with a blog called "rambleon" in 2021 does.

More on that later, for now as I write these words, Bill Withers is singing on the Sonos:

_Then I look at you_<br>
_And the world's alright with me_<br>
_Just one look at you_<br>
_And I know it's gonna be_<br>
_A lovely day (lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)_<br>

And the sun is shining, and the world outside beckons.

In the meantime - the [wildlife is still here](https://rambleon.org/2018/05/21/mutual-of-hillsboroughs-wild-kingdom/) - this early summer we've been entertained by a juvenile barred owl just learning to find its own way in the world - and I leave you with their closeup debut from the week:
