Ignore these. They are just my own private little joke. Publicly recorded to remind myself that it can get bad when the System Administrator is the anal one about communication. But Iâ€™ve always been that way (youâ€™d think thatâ€™d Iâ€™d learn to [write better][1], but alas, thatâ€™s not the case).

But anyway, onto my private little joke:

> eXtension is A natural extension of the growth of national collaborative eXtension is A value-added eXtension is A place where agreements and standards

_What?!?_ should be your natural reaction â€” it was mine too. ðŸ™‚
