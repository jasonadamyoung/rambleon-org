I started _really_ questioning [this blog post][1] about the 20 ugliest college campuses in the USA ([via John Gruber][2]) when I was reading and _wasn’t_ seeing NC State University.

But never fear, we are the 7th ugliest campus in the USA. Whew. I believe the credibility now.

And that being said, the top 6 must be absolutely _wretched_
