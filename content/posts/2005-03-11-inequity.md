There are 2000+ software projects at sourceforge.net in the category of “Editors”

There are two, **_TWO!_**, open source tournament bracket management tools suitable for the [NCAA basketball tourney][1] that I’ve managed to find.

Clearly the priorities of the open source programmers are out of whack.
