I’ve been going back and “porting” a lot of miscellaneous documentation and email essays I had lying around into the [wiki][1] section of this here website. (hint: click “recent” beside the “Default” space).

Some of it is worthwhile, some of it is just long. All of it is rambly.

But it may make an interesting addition to your RSS feeds.
