So, [a MacDevCenter][1] article last week highlighted Mac bloggers/developers and asked them what Macintosh they used — which is a great Macintosh blogosphere question. Now whether I’m part of the Macintosh blogosphere or not is debatable, but like I care. I’m answering the question for myself anyway.

(and it’s also a _great_ [PackMUG][2] question too, which I think I’ll ask after I get done ego-pimping here).

Now, the best list of Macs that you can find anywhere is probably the one embedded in the [MacTracker application][3]. But the [Apple Macintosh][4] article at Wikipedia is pretty useful too.

My Macintosh at home is a Dual 1.25GHz Power Macintosh G4, “Mirrored Drive Doors” model with 2GB RAM, a 64MB ATI Radeon 9000 Pro, and a 115GB ATA66 Hard drive (36G Free). I have a 20in Apple Cinema Display (the DVI model). It’s 3 years old next month, and I’m still really happy with it (which is more than I can say for any Windows-based PC I ever owned for that long).

The semi-funny history of it is that in February 2003, I was completely fed up with my home-built PC and completely fed up with Windows XP. I had just watched my first MacWorld Keynote (I had a Macintosh Powerbook at work that I started using in November 2002) the month prior — and Apple had announced their FW800 Macintosh G4. I went to the Apple Store in Durham to buy it. Well, the Apple Store didn’t have the new PowerMacs in yet, but I wanted one, and wanted one RIGHT THEN — so I bought the discontinued model (the first PMG4/MDD went from August 2002 to January 2003). I didn’t really care about the bluetooth, the ATA/100 or the FW800, which was basically the only difference between it and the January 2003 announced PMG4.

I started with 1GB RAM and had it hooked up to a 19” CRT monitor until last summer. The only upgrades I’ve done to it are the upgrade to 2GB RAM, buying a second 120GB hard drive because the IBM Drive it came with was irritatingly loud, so I put it into a external Firewire enclosure. I put a Kensington bluetooth adapter on it, and I had an SiiG podunk PCI USB 2.0 card that I bought for an earlier PC, but it worked just fine in the Macintosh, so it has USB 2.0 also. I did the Apple Power Supply/Fan replacement so it’s not too loud at all. It’s seen upgrades from Jaguar to Panther to Tiger — and that’s about it.

My next home macintosh will be whatever “Power Macintosh” Intel-equivalent (the business line, not the iMac line) that they release this year. Just because. I had one of the first PowerMacintoshes (the 6100) years ago, so I figure I’ll take a jump on the 1st-Generation Intel desktops too. However, if Apple manages to release a tablet Macintosh — I’m all over that. Have credit, will buy computers I don’t need 🙂

My Macintosh at work is a Dual 2.0Ghz Power Mac G5 (Early 2005 model) with 2.0GB RAM, a 160GB SATA HDD, and a 256MB ATI Radeon 9650. I have a 20in Apple Cinema Display (DVI) at work too.

The funny work story is I had the chance to get a 23in Apple Cinema Display, but decided against it, because I really didn’t want to have monitor envy when I went home. (for real 🙂 )

Sometime soon I should recount all the home and work Macintoshes I’ve used (only on the desktop, the Xserves and supported Macs won’t count — okay except maybe for the [Macintosh Portable][5] I supported at GTE 😉 )

So inquiring minds want to know — what’s YOUR macintosh?
