I had several hundred unread news items in Google Reader for the last several days — I haven’t had time to read them at home — or at work since Monday. I’ve read a few here and there, mostly speed-scanning and starring ones with interesting titles and summaries.

I have about an hour tonight that I was going to go through them. And in “All items” view — I just accidentally clicked “Mark All As Read”. (I think I thought I was looking at a tag/group view). I’m not sure whether my “oooooouuuuuug” was audible — but dang.

And then I felt suddenly and completely liberated.

I really must do that more often.
