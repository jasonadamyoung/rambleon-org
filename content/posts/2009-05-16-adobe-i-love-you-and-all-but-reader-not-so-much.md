An Adobe support rep [commented on the last post about the fun with fillable PDFs][1]

You get mad props for commenting really, thatâ€™s awesome. While I think itâ€™s a bit of an excuse (hey, Iâ€™ve used it, been there done that) I totally grok the incompatibilities between the interpretations of the [PDF standard][2].

Just for kicks, I even downloaded the 8.6MB PDF file and went to go look at the section on forms just to see how onerous it was (section 12.7 it looks like). Iâ€™m totally glad I donâ€™t have to program reference implementations of that. But I think people that programmed postscript are like those people that understand sendmail configuration files â€” that is, not like the rest of us mere mortals.

Look, I donâ€™t mind PDF files. Itâ€™s better than dealing with word docs â€” particularly for read-only conent. And I like Photoshop, and I adore Adobe Lightroom. But just a minor recommendation â€” pimping Adobe Reader as a solution? you just donâ€™t really want to go there. I mean have you used Adobe Reader on a Macintosh recently? Really?

But hey, since you went there. Why not? I have always avoided installing Adobe Reader on the Macintosh at home, because itâ€™s historically been slow, bloated, and frustrating. But itâ€™s been awhile, so why not try it again? Maybe it will solve things.

Surprisingly 9.1.0 is a bit snappier. That was pleasant. But I tried importing that file I was working onâ€¦ and well, the experience was no better than using the full CS3 Acrobat:

Maybe this is all Previewâ€™s fault. You know, you and Apple, you donâ€™t always see eye to eye, what if I just use Reader end-to-end?

Oh wait, I get this:

![Adobe Reader Warning][3]

Well, at least that dialog is not 751 pixels wide like this one:

![Cannot Save From][4]

So preview lets me save the file with the text in it, but Reader doesnâ€™t, Reader 9.1 and Acrobat CS3 both have this disappearing form text problem, maybe itâ€™s the source PDF, maybe itâ€™s whatever.

I do this like once a millenium, so itâ€™s not like I care. I think itâ€™s mostly funny. And and bit of Fail! And borderline frustrating when I support others that blame my systems for things like this ðŸ™‚

p.s. [Benâ€™s right, this totally needs a little hip-hop treatment.][5]
