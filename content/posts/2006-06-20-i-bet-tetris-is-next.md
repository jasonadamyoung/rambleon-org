[Good grief, it’s the return of Emacs][1]

I love textmate. And I haven’t used a single bundle yet. (though I bet the Subversion bundle rocks). But… sheesh.

(speaking of textmate, a huge thanks to [Duff][2] for telling me about Ctrl+S — before I knew about that, TextMate Find and its modeless-find-dialog-that-doesn’t-show-up-in-the-window-menu was driving me nuts).
