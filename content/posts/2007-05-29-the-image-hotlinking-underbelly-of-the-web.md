Wow.

I started checking my referer logs (okay, actually technorati, google analytics, and my hosting providers webstats) â€” and it seems that [this image][1] (the one in my previous memorial day post) of a gravestone at the Raleigh National Cemetery that I took in May 2004 has spread like wildfire.

Thatâ€™s actually a wonderful thing. I license the image under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike][2] license that Flickr facilitates â€” which would be all well and good â€” spread the image far and wide, in my mind â€” just attribute or link back to Flickr where the copyright terms and author information is.

However, it seems that the one that was stored in the WordPress uploads directory for a previous iteration of my [Memorial Day Page][3] from last year is suddenly getting hotlinked in the most far-flung forums that you could imagine (and Iâ€™m amazed at how many communities pop up all over the place). While I know all about the rewrite rules to play fun games with that â€” Iâ€™m just not into redirecting those image requests to nastygrams, lolcats or worse â€” and I donâ€™t yet want to restrict images to my own site (because that tends to break the feed readers)

For this case I just yanked the images and will let them 404. My little tiny long tail site is still well under the bandwidth cap â€” but I donâ€™t need a bunch of image hotlinks. Especially the multi-thousand hotlinks from myspace â€” let them go to flickr or attributed derivative works. Itâ€™s annoying enough that they violate the Creative Commons terms â€” but bandwidth leeching makes it doubly so.

I knew this kind of stuff happened. But itâ€™s amazing to see how it spreads like it does.

I may track this for a while yet. Iâ€™ve see a few unattributed reworks also â€” some are just inclusions of the image without attribution in blogs. I sent a note or two to the bloggers inviting them to link to the flickr image under the Creative Commons terms. Some are just incredibly ugly PC-paint borders around it with flashing text meant for myspace layouts. But Iâ€™m really not the kind of person oriented to doing DMCA takedowns â€” not for this at least (although doing selective enforcement for those sites that violate my aesthetic tastes crossed my mind multiple times ðŸ˜‰ ) If it helps folks honor our fallen soldiers for Memorial Day, then so be it I guess (of course, I say that and watch some fool next year pass it off to a media outlet as their own)

Of course, what will be really annoying is if someone else tries a DMCA takedown on me for my own image.

[update: I decided to wrap the most-hotlinked one with a copyright and link text. Iâ€™d like to see how far itâ€™s spread after a bit â€” and while I still have bandwidth in my account, itâ€™ll be interesting to parse the logs on it]
