From me in email:

> run-of-the-mill developers fix things great developers fix things and share those fixes with their colleagues

I don’t do this as often as I should, but by damn I’m going to get better at it. There’s absolutely no excuse for making a fix, and not being aware that your fix might be useful for other tools that your colleagues work on.
