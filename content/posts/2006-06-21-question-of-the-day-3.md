So if [design by committee][1] is a derogatory term, and time after time committees are shown to be completely antithetical to innovation, and experience shows that most committees tend to degrade into having one or two or three people do all the work, and its often the case that the committee decisions are just ignored anywayâ€¦

Why in sam heck do we continue time and time again to have committees? _Especially_ in University environments?
