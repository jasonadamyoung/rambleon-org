Last year, I created an eBay account because I momentarily thought that I might advertise a Harley motorcycle that I had for sale there (I didn’t, because I ended up selling it to a peer system administrator on campus). After a few months of getting eBay spams, I clicked the “please don’t send me more mail” link. Which was great, until December 26th &#8211; when eBay “revised” their privacy policy, and sure enough, reset my eBay spam preference.

I thought Yahoo! was the only idiotic large internet company that did this. Obviously I was wrong.

The fine print is even worse:

> If you do not wish to receive further communications, sign into “My eBay” by clicking on the “My eBay” link found at the top of the eBay home page and change your Notification Preferences. Please note that it may take up to 10 days to process your request

10 days?!?Â Nice webapplication you have there, eBay.
