So I’m not going to even talk about the [iLife][1] upgrade, or the new [Pages][2] application, or the [iPod Shuffle][3] or the [Macintosh Mini][4].

BareBones released a **free** version of [TextWrangler][5] with PHP syntax support!

I’m not sure I’ll switch from [jEdit][6] yet, but I’m no longer allowing myself to cuss at BareBones.
