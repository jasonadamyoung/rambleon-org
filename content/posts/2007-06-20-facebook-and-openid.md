So, after finding the only webform contact I could find to contact facebook &#8211; I have to say that I was impressed that I got an answer:

> Hi Jason,

The Facebook Platform does not currently support the method you are requesting. We are always making improvements to our platform, and we will certainly keep this functionality in mind for future releases. Keep your eye on the Developers Homepage Latest News section (http://developers.facebook.com/) for new information.

Thanks again, Greg Customer Support Representative Facebook

Hey folk,

We are looking to build on Facebook with as much of the Cooperative Extension system as we can try to evangelize about the platform.

We really would like to grow our FB use on our OpenID provider &#8211; who in FB can I contact about any possibilities for OpenID integration?

Thanks, Jason Young Systems Manager, National Extension Initiative

Which is nice that they actually answered, but it’s not quite good enough. Like [Kevin said][1] I’m all for them becoming a provider. But what they really need to be is a _consumer_. They lose nothing (other than having to support people’s passwords. And we gain a lot.

So come on Facebook &#8211; do OpenID.
