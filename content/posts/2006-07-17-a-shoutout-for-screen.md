Thank goodness for [screen][1] and for me remembering to use it.

I managed to lock my macintosh up hard trying to copy 20GB of Data from one drive to another. really hard. Like no mouse and keyboard response hard. With my shell open to the server processing my gimongous log file data set already [immortalized in song][2] today.

That would have completely stunk without being run in screen, as such, it was pop open the laptop, shell into the log server and a quick screen -d -r later, Iâ€™m happily watching basically nothing other than a line kicked out to the console for every 8192 lines processed.

but what a sweet uninterrupted nothing it is.
