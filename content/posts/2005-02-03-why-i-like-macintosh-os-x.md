[This is one of the reasons I like Macintosh OS X][1] &#8211; option+drag-and-drop an image into a terminal window to set a background image for the window. Great fun.

Though in the sage words of a co-worker:

<div class="highlighter-rouge">
  <pre class="highlight"><code>1:16:54 [coworker]: I always found that distracting1:18:04 jayoung@jabber.eos.ncsu.edu: I guess it depends on the image</code></pre>
</div>
