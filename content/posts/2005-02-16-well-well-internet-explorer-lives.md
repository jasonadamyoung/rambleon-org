Following on the heels of [my commentary][1] and everyone else’s in the known Universe for the last several, um, **YEARS**…

Microsoft announced [Internet Explorer 7][2] (via: [Mary Jo Foley][3] and a thousand other news outlets).

I’m not sure whether to laugh, cry, or both. But for now let’s just say that I’m hopeful.

Really, hopeful.

No, I’m not joking about that.

Really.

Honest.
