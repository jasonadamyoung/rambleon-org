Believe it or not, of all things, I’m writing PHP code tonight to the _[The Rocky Story][1]_

It makes me run faster, but I’m not sure that it makes me _type_ faster.

_Smokestack, fatback,  
many miles of railroad track  
All night radio, keep on runnin’  
through your rock ‘n’ roll soul  
All night diners keep you awake,  
hey, on black coffee and a hard roll_

You might have to walk the fine line,  
you might take the hard line  
But everybody’s working overtime

Living in America — eye to eye, station to station  
Living in America — hand to hand, across the nation  
Living in America — got to have a celebration

I’m resisting the urge to do the Numa Numa Dance.
