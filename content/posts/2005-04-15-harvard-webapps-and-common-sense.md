Phillip Greenspun [followed up on the Harvard Business School applicant [non]-“hacking” incident][1] yesterday.

His description helped underscore this incident as something that is a [priority practices for my group][2]. I don’t want a screwup on our part creating a situation where one of our students is accused of “hacking” (unless they willfully and maliciously attempt to exploit that screwup).

At some point there has to be a modicum of common sense. I’m not sure why in computing security “common sense” seems to fly out of the window.

See also a [somewhat related Slashdot thread][3] about network security scans and lack of common sense.
