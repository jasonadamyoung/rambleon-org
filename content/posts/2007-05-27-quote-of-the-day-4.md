[From Terry Chay:][1]

> Be honest about the consequences of your actions: whether it is the programming language you choose, a framework/[no-framework][2] you adopt, a design pattern you apply, or the choice to simply download someone else’s application and install it. Choose wisely. A lack of self-reflection leads to a poor choice and spells disaster.

I soooo wish I could get this across to more people. My experience in higher education is that we’ll form task forces and work teams over graphics and documents &#8211; but there’s way too much “just write this application” or “just install this software” or “there’s this extension that does this…”
