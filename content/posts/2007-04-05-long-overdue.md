It was long overdue &#8211; mainly just laziness on my part.

Anyone, anywhere reading this blog is free to reproduce my original content and adapt it as you see fit, provided that you provide attribution (a link back to this site is good enough for me) &#8211; and that you are doing it in a non-commercial fashion. (the Creative Commons license defines commercial as an activity ‚Äúintended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation‚Äù).

I can‚Äôt for the life of me figure out why you‚Äôd want to however üôÇ

I know that this isn‚Äôt a totally free license. I‚Äôm still not quite progressive enough to remove the non-commercial clause from my words or my photos. I‚Äôll get there one day.
