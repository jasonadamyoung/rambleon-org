So, the [University of Colorado at Boulder got hacked][1].

Again, [just like the University of Connecticut][2] Colorado seems to have a need to blame their peers.

From the [FAQ][3]:

> **Has this happened at other universities?**  
> Over the past few years, there has been a notable increase in hacking activity aimed at colleges and universities, institutions that are known for their culture of openness and the sharing of information. Also, because of their high bandwidth, university networks are attractive to those engaged in file sharing. Computer systems storing personal student and employee information have been breached recently at numerous universities, including University of Texas at Austin, New York University, University of California at San Diego, University of California at Berkeley, and Purdue University.

Hey, but at least the PR department spelled “Berkeley” correctly.
