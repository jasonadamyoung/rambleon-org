[What he said][1]

Iâ€™ve worn way too many computing hats to be good at much at any of it. So I mostly focus on systems architecture (of which about the only thing Iâ€™m really any good at is heads-down troubleshooting, code, systems, networks, whatever). Iâ€™m certainly not a developer, but Iâ€™ve written more perl, c, shell, and php than I ever should have been allowed to.

But you know, when it came to putting up a web site for mine and Amyâ€™s wedding. I kind of freaked a little. I didnâ€™t want to code anything. I could have hand-rolled html, but hand-rolling even 5 or 6 pages, especially 5 or 6 page of valid XHTML and CSS is not really all that fun. And copy-editing HTML pages, even a simple divâ€™d out arrangement is a setup for syntax errors. Not to mention every time you make a little change you have to upload everything again.

I tried out iWeb, Sandvox, and RapidWeaver â€“ and while nice little applications, and light-years beyond the last one of these simple wysiwyg editors I used (Netscape Composer for those playing along with the home game) â€“ they really arenâ€™t very flexible. I couldnâ€™t coax the design she wanted out of them. (just changing background colors is **quite** the challenge).

So I banged my head against the wall a while, but ended up going with wordpress. And it worked out. I liberated a wordpress theme (Yay for open source licensing!) that was something close to what it needed to be, and I played with the CSS, and I played with the .php files &#8211; and I finally managed to get something:

that worked.

We could edit online rather simply, each with our own update account. WordPress has static pages (and thereâ€™s always that blog thing if we wanted it). And it worked. You canâ€™t even really tell itâ€™s WordPress. Of course itâ€™s complete overkill for 8 pages of text. But it made it easy. I only had to modify and troubleshoot, not create.

It was easy. But only because all this stuff was licensed in a way that I could do derivative works and make it look like I (she ðŸ˜‰ ) wanted.
