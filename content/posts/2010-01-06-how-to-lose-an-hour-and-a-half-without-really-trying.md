Log in to your work gmail account and see:

 ![][1](the “chat” block goes on ad infinitum)

And then watch your MailPlane application — and then Safari completely go into spinning beach ball of death. Then you:

  * Test another account — works
  * Test Firefox — works
  * Test Chrome — works
  * Remove labs, themes, clear out the inbox — go back, doesn’t work
  * Uninstall flash — doesn’t work
  * Resinstall flash — doesn’t work
  * You try to run Safari’s dev tools before it locks up  — get incomprehensible error codes from google’s minimized js
  * You get locked out of your gmail entirely because you keep trying too many different browsers
  * Lather, rinse, repeat

This is the kind of stuff I really don’t enjoy about my job anymore.
