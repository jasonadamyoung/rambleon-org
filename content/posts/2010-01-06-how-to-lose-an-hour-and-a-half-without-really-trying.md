Log in to your work gmail account and see:

 ![][1](the “chat” block goes on ad infinitum)

And then watch your MailPlane application &#8211; and then Safari completely go into spinning beach ball of death. Then you:

  * Test another account &#8211; works
  * Test Firefox &#8211; works
  * Test Chrome &#8211; works
  * Remove labs, themes, clear out the inbox &#8211; go back, doesn’t work
  * Uninstall flash &#8211; doesn’t work
  * Resinstall flash &#8211; doesn’t work
  * You try to run Safari’s dev tools before it locks up  &#8211; get incomprehensible error codes from google’s minimized js
  * You get locked out of your gmail entirely because you keep trying too many different browsers
  * Lather, rinse, repeat

This is the kind of stuff I really don’t enjoy about my job anymore.
