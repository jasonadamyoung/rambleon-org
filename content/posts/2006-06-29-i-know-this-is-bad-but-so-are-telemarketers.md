I knew I shouldn’t have as soon as the caller id on the office phone showed 00000000000…

But I answered the phone, and gave my customary work phone greeting I’ve had for 8 years: “This is Jason.”

pause, other end picks up, I know it’s a computer-based dialer on the other side. The voice is nice enough, “Can I speak to Jason Young?”

Me, knowing what this is, kicks into rude mode: “Yes, unless you are a telemarketer”

[silence]

Me, “Guess that means you are”

They hang up. How rude
