(also, one of the reasons that I stay subscribed to the Surfin’ Safari blog)

_[Updated] — Edited “Hyatt Safari” to be “Surfin Safari” — I **completely** missed that folks other than Dave Hyatt were posting to the blog — which is what I get for not having the author column turned on for some blogs in NetNewsWire. The article I linked to was written by Maciej Stachowiak. Sorry about that webkit crew_
