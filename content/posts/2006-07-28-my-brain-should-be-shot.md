So, it’s getting toward the end of the month.

And I’m thinking about the webstats we run. And the webstats are produced today based on yesterday’s data.

And I think to myself, “Self, what happens on the first of the month?”

And Self responds “you stupid idiot, you produce output directories based on today for yesterday”

Sigh. Why can’t I wait until after the bugs manifest themselves and people complain to fix them like 90% of the rest of the IT companies in the world?

p.s. using <code class="highlighter-rouge">date --date=yesterday</code> works great in shell scripts
