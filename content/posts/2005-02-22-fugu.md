[FUGU 1.1.2][1] has been released. Macintosh OS X users should download it.

Now.

Actually, if you chose not to download it (you should), just **don’t use FTP**

Use [carrier pigeons][2] before you use FTP.

You can download other applications, like [FTPeel][3], [Transmit][4], or [Cyberduck][5] &#8211; just whatever you do:

# Don’t Use FTP {#dont-use-ftp}
