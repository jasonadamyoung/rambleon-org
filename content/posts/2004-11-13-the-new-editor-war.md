It seems to be the new emacs vs. vi vs. pico &#8211; though with somewhat more visible presence. See [here][1] , [here][2] and [here][3]

But for me, Goodbye [Safari][4]

I have switched to [Firefox][5]

The final straw was a problem cutting and pasting source code from [php.net][7]

and the [extensions][8] really make the browser.
