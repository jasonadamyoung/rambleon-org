Hmmmm… [Microsoft Watch][1] suddenly went to a subscriber-only model.

I tried clicking on the non-fulltext(*) RSS feed only to have the site redirect me to a “get an account” / “Subscription required” page for Ziff Davis.

Oh well, it was real, and fun and, well you know the rest.

Unsubscribed.

(*: off the topic note: I don’t mind non-fulltext RSS feeds, it’s fine with me if feeds have enough of a teaser, and then they can direct me to the site and get me to look at their site layout, advertising, etc. — I understand the arguments [like this one at codepoetry][2], and I’m not [Winer][3] or [Scoble][4] — I don’t download my feeds to read later on the plane)
