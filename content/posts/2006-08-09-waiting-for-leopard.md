It probably sounds completely weird, but one of my biggest changes in switching to the Macintosh is that I’ve actually kept my Macintosh as my primary desktop longer than any other computer I’ve owned. (Ok, so I have a 20” intel iMac and a Macbook at work, and a bunch of servers to manage, so that sort of tempers things a bit &#8211; but I’ve always had relatively modern desktop and server computers at work, so it doesn’t temper it that much).

But I’ve actually had my Macintosh 3 and a half years. And it’s still going pretty strong. Really stong actually. Now, I’ve put a off-brand USB 2.0 PCI card in it &#8211; and 2GB of RAM. And I have a second 120GB HDD where the music files are sitting.

But I really don’t have an excuse to buy the [Mac Pro][1] right now. And I can’t really come up with a good one (getting married tempers that too 😉 ).

But I am pretty excited about Leopard. And I imagine that a 4+year old computer in the spring will make [Leopard][2] and a Mac Pro will be a pretty tempting combination 😀
