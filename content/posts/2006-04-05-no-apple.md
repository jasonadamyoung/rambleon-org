[BootCamp][1] is _not it_. We want VMWare for MacIntel. Dual-booting is so 1990’s. One or the other OS is going to be neglected, and be ripe for security problems, etc.

I want my friendly Macintosh OS and run the few Windows applications I have to run. Which usually seem to turn out to be platform-specific Java from VMWare, Dell, and Cisco.

**[Update]**. p.s. Apple, this is going to be any IT staff person’s worst nightmare come true. Exceptmaybepossibly for the IT staff person themselves personally for their own system. Get on with the virtualization already.
