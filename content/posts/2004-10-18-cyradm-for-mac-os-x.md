(alternatively titled “things that make a sysadmin happy”)

It’s really, really, really nice to have [cyradm][1] available for Mac OS X — thanks to the fine contributors to the [fink project][2].

(hint: I had to reinstall XCode with every darn compiler it has to get it to compile — I think it really needs gcc3.1)

I now can way more easily manage shared mailboxes _without_ shelling into the IMAP server.

Maybe I’ll finally write the perl script for mass update of shared mailbox permissions that I can’t seem to find at all that anyone has written previously. Though I know that they just had to have done that by now.
