According to [this Windows IT Pro article][1] ([via Engadet][2]). Windows Sysadmins will have multiple new Windows Vista versions to deal with. That’s right — no longer will you have to tear your hair out fighting issues with convincing the faculty/staff/students you support to get XP Professional instead of XP Home, now you’ll be able to choose from a support nightmare of **seven** different versions!

  * Windows Vista Starter Edition
  * Windows Vista Home Basic Edition
  * Windows Vista Home Premium Edition
  * Windows Vista Ultimate Edition
  * Windows Vista Small Business Edition
  * Windows Vista Professional Edition
  * Windows Vista Enterprise Edition

All brought to you by Microsoft, creators of other fine Marketing products in the past, like “Microsoft BOB”

* * *

Bonus commentary from the jabber chatroom:

Brian: hey, maybe ultimate edition will come in a nice collector’s tin with a few free trading cards  
Jason M: ooooo  
Jason M: maybe holo foils  
Margaret: gotta catch ‘em all  
Jason Y: just what I’ve always wanted — holographic foils of the [Microsoft Executives][3]  
Jason Y: that might could generate revenue though, people will have to buy multiple Ultimate editions to collect the whole set

I wonder if Robert Scoble will get his own card?
