Dear Facebook,

[What James said][1]

_Hotel California_ is particularly appropo I thought.

You lose nothing implementing feeds and an OpenID consumer — and you gain a lot. You’ve already shown you had a modicum of sense — but going only part way doesn’t cut it.

Now get with the program.

p.s. This will also be my last post on the matter. Not that you particularly care. But I think the platform is promising enough that I’ve wasted two posts on you — but I’ll move on. Without feeds and open authentication — you won’t.
