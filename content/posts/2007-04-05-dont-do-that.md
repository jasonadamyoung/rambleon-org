So‚Ä¶ maybe you are coding up your totally way rad awesome application in Rails &#8211; and you are thinking to yourself.

‚ÄúSelf, I really would like to set my own created\_at and updated\_at timestamps. Look &#8211; [there‚Äôs even a way to do that in the Rails documentation][1]‚Äù

>  <code class="highlighter-rouge">class Feed &lt; ActiveRecord::Base self.record_timestamps = false # ... end </code>

At this point you need to back away from the keyboard. Quickly. If you don‚Äôt, pretty soon, somewhere in your application &#8211; you are going to run into this error:

> <code class="highlighter-rouge">Mysql::Error: Column 'created_at' cannot be null</code>

Or ALL KINDS OF OTHER FUN SIDE EFFECTS (FUN is actually a euphemism here for various four letter words)

See, record_timestamps is a _class variable_ for <code class="highlighter-rouge">ActiveRecord::Base</code> created with the rails :cattr_accessor &#8211; maybe the <code class="highlighter-rouge">self.record_timestamps</code> should have tipped us all off &#8211; maybe not (there‚Äôs also a class\_inheritable\_accessor &#8211; I‚Äôm not sure where all that gets used though)

Even experienced developers not all that fluent in ruby minutiae (I think class variables count as minutiae) cut-and-paste first and figure out how it works second (yeah, don‚Äôt do that either).

So &#8211; anyway &#8211; once you change record_timestamps once &#8211; you change it for all descendants of <code class="highlighter-rouge">ActiveRecord::Base</code>

There‚Äôs a bit of discussion this on a separate, but related problem at [Evan Weaver‚Äôs blog][2] (pay special attention to that threading issue for those playing along with the home game). And of course, your friendly neighborhood reminder of what happens with class variables at [Nic Williams‚Äô blog][3] (I recommend reading that twice and breaking out the home game version of irb)

So the moral of the story? <code class="highlighter-rouge">self.record_timestamps</code> &#8211; Don‚Äôt Do That.

p.s. Production of this blog entry was made possible through various grants and assessments, and with some moans, groans, sighs, and ‚Äúwhat tha‚Äì?‚Äù from my colleagues [James Robinson][4] and Aaron Hundley (doesn‚Äôt have a blog, he needs to get with the program) üôÇ

p.p.s edited to change ‚Äúyou chance it for all descendants‚Ä¶‚Äù to ‚Äúyou change it for all descendants‚Äù &#8211; I think the first one is quite _apropos_ however
