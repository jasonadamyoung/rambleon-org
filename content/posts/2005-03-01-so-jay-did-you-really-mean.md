So did I really mean:

> [I hope we do everything we can do to get rid of every last Microsoft product we use.][1]

No, I really donâ€™t mean that. My aversion to platform mandates and making sure we have an open environment where students can use, experiment with, and make use of Linux, Solaris, Macintosh OS, Windows, Longhorn, XINU, whatever also precludes acting out my reactionary frustations to Microsoft licensing.

Iâ€™m just **extremely** frustrated with the byzantine software licensing model that Microsoft has.

I honestly think we are covered under our [MSDN Academic Alliance][2] licensing, but this still, ahem, burns my biscuits.

( _which you can obviously tell because I keep going on and on about it ðŸ™‚_ )
