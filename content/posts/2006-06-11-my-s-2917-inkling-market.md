Following along the whole network neutrality thing: I’m trying out an [Inkling Market for Senate bill 2917.][1]

> The issue of Network Neutrality is raging on the Internet, in the press, and in Congress right now. On June 8th, the “COPE Bill” (HR. 5252) passed the house, and an admendment to protect network neutrality was rejected. The focus turns to the Senate, where S.2917 is currently in committee, and attempts to provide an admendment to the 1934 Telecommunications Act with language to preserve Network Neutrality.

See: <http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:s.02917:>

for information about S.2917

I’m currently losing all my inkles on the President’s Approval Rating. So I have to have something to do there.
