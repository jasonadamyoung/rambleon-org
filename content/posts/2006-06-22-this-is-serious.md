[Tim Berners-Lee: Net Neutrality: This is Serious][1]

The most cogent and clear definition yet of Net Neutrality I’ve read yet:

> “Net neutrality is this:

‘If I pay to connect to the Net with a certain quality of service, and you pay to connect with that or greater quality of service, then we can communicate at that level.’

That’s all. Its up to the ISPs to make sure they interoperate so that that happens.

Net Neutrality is NOT asking for the internet for free.

Net Neutrality is NOT saying that one shouldn’t pay more money for high quality of service. We always have, and we always will.”

There’s multiple clear, concise statements here. So [Read the article][1] You’ll be glad you did.
