I hate HTML and XML Character Encoding, what a nightmare.

This all started yesterday. Actually, this all started several days ago with a post to our [Campus ‚ÄúNetwork Administrators Group‚Äù][1] [mailing list][2] ‚Äî in which I opined on the benefits of RSS and RSS aggregators and queried for the group‚Äôs favorites.

Well, a couple of people pointed out that [Thunderbird][3] does RSS ‚Äî ala an old fashioned NewsReader. So I wanted to try it out.

Only the current release of Thunderbird doesn‚Äôt natively provide support for importing a bunch of subscriptions (using, say an [OPML][4]. file). Well, that led me to [this blog entry][5] Which adds OPML import/export support to Thunderbird.

Cool right? Well somedays it doesn‚Äôt pay to get out of bed and write your own weblog software.

See, on import of my [NetNewsWire][6] OPML output, Thunderbird reported that two of the feeds were invalid.

RSS feeds are XML, and like any XML/XHTML source ‚Äî they should be [valid XML][7]. However, it practically seems that this can be a total nightmare.

When [EWE][8] was released, I checked all the feeds with sample data at [feedvalidator.org][9] to make sure things looked okay.

Valid RSS right?

Well, valid until it wasn‚Äôt valid üôÇ

What broke one of the feeds was the innocuous Copyright symbol. (C) In the source text, it was actually the copyright symbol ( (C) ). I have been dutifully running the RSS output through the [htmlentities()][10] function, to convert things like that to their HTML entities representation. XML doesn‚Äôt know anything about HTML entities built-in, except for just a few. I understand that, but you‚Äôd think that I could supply some namespace or something and fix that.

Well, I probably can, but I don‚Äôt understand that. Trying to understand would likely make me curse a lot (more).

So I tried the xmlentities() function that was buried in the comments for [htmlentities()][10] ‚Äî that was nice until it didn‚Äôt do the &nbsp because PHP‚Äôs [get\_html\_translation_table()][11] has a limited set of entries in it, none of which are &nbsp ‚Äî which isn‚Äôt valid for XML.

So, heretofore I found [this article][12] ‚Äî which has 2000+ translations.

So now I run the RSS text through htmlentities ‚Äî then through a [strtr()][13] with the gigantic translation table (with the < and > and &amp translations commented out).

I think I‚Äôve fixed things ‚Äî until something else breaks.

But by then ‚Äî I think I‚Äôll be like [this chap][14] and if:

> <div class="highlighter-rouge">
>   <pre class="highlight"><code>1) You can type a character on the keyboard;  2) Browsers can display it (they better if (1) is true)  3) Printers can print it  4) Humans can read it	then the RSS feed is valid. This whole valid-invalid BS is making RSS difficult for both reader makers and publishers.</code></pre></p>
> </div>

Until then:
