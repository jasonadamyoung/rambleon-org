![No matter when you buy an Apple product, you can be assured that they'll release an updated version right after you do.  Well, except for that 20th Anniversary thing.  And it took awhile for the Newton, but I'm sure somebody bought one off ebay right before the iPhone release.  Though they probably bought it to run linux.  Or a web server.][1]

Apple Product cycles, you have to love them.
