I think it’s from doing software upgrades all week.

Could someone please, please, please [send a bunch of emails about unsubscribing from lists or something][1]? I need an outlet.

Otherwise, I’m going to likely pick on old-skool flickr users (though [Chuq][2] already did that better, though not as snarky) or Joe Biden, or John Edwards, or Dick Cheney, or American Idol. And quite frankly all of the latter ones are all boring and have about the same relevance to reality(*)

Dear computing users of the world, please do something stupid so I can make fun of you, followed by the realization that I do the exact same thing, whereupon I can write some hilarious self-deprecating followup.

(* wow, managed to sneak one in, without even meaning it)
