I’m actually really enjoying the whole Red Hat thing. I found myself actually spec’ing Intel/AMD hardware today for a tiny little desktop machine that I could run linux on personally and play. Though it’s still too expensive to do a new machine to just play (I’ll just buy my parents a Macintosh at some point and get back their PC and run Linux on it).

Though, I really don’t see myself shifting from the Macintosh on the desktop. In the server room, however, I really forsee a lot more Linux than OS X. And I wasn’t quite expecting myself to actually believe in that. But I’m even more comfortable now with Red Hat (and Sun/IBM/Dell/etc. server hardware) than OS X (and Xserves) in the server space.

However, also for the record, I am thoroughly unimpressed with RPM.
