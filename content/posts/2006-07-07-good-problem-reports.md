I was reminded of [this post in 2003][1] by Brent Simmons ([NetNewsWire][2]’s developer) about good bug reports. It’s also echoed in [this note from Joel Spolsky][3].

I’m going to add to Brent’s just a bit, but this should be shared far and wide. **_Especially_** among the IT staff. IT staff are the absolute **_worst_** (pot, kettle, black) when it comes to bug reports. Worse even than faculty ;-). Smart people seem to turn their brains off with problem reports. Which they never would tolerate in the own discipline or support area.

Effective bug reports should include:

  1. What you did. This should include as much detail as possible. And for web applications — please include the URL where the problem occurred and your operating system and browser/client software!
  2. What you expected.
  3. What actually happened.
