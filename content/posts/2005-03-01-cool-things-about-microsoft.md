So [Microsoft Product Licensing][1] is evil.

And so is [building web pages that have useful information][2] so that they only work in Internet Explorer for Windows (**for absolutely no good reason mind you**, this is not a multimedia site like [MSNBC][3] which I almost understand only working in IE sometimes).

So let me tell you what’s good about Microsoft:

  * The [Xbox][4]
  * [Microsoft Research][5]
  * [Microsoft Tablet PC’s][6]
  * [Brad Abrams][7] &#8211; a former college friend, who I spent many long programming sessions with trying to get our operating systems projects (long live Zoot!) done
  * [Robert Scoble][8] &#8211; who is putting a human face on the innovation that’s actually being done at Microsoft (being killed by their product licensing group and lawyers)
  * [Channel9][9] and [Raymond Chen][10] &#8211; I don’t read the Channel9 blogs because I don’t develop Windows software anymore. But Raymond Chen is cool &#8211; had he been writing like that when I was developing software, I still might be a Windows geek
  * \*\* (update) \*\* The [MSDN Academic Alliance][11] (which likely takes the sting out of some of the product licensing headache for our virtual computing lab)
  * Microsoft [Developer Support][12] in general

And I’m sure that’s lots more really cool things going on inside Redmond.

Too bad their product licensing division is evil.
