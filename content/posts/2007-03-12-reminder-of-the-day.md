Set the correct time on your cameras. Which I unfortunately failed to do for a bunch of pictures taken today.

But chalk one up for yet more things I don’t understand — my D80 knows about time zones and DST — why the heck doesn’t it automatically change?

(unless of course I had the setting wrong to begin with… hmmmm)
