following my [previous whoppers][1] &#8211; there’s this one from this morning (which is why, even if I manage a eureka! moment before 7am, I shouldn’t be emailing about it)

> But I started having some issues with images/styles/javascripts that were likely related to incomplete stanzas in my apache config &#8211; but that I thought might be proxy related. There’s also a hardcoded /images instead of images/ reference in apps/views/layouts/heureka.html which also makes relocating the application having missing things and I didn’t know how many more of those there might be so I said to heck with it and ran it at its own vhosts since we aren’t currently running multiple rails apps in a single vhost.

Huh?

Which of course, deserves another Casey Stengel quote:

\_When you are younger you get blamed for crimes you never committed and when you’re older you begin to get credit for virtues you never possessed. It evens itself out. \_

I’ll always be Young.
