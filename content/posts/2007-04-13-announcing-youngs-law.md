Young’s Law:

“Every stop-gap becomes a permanent feature in applications written in University environments.”

corollary a:

“Every internal application eventually becomes an external application, with no additional design or resources granted to make it so.”

corollary b:

“All external application users will eventually complain about the design quality of the given application and wonder why on earth such an application was ever released to begin with.”

corollary c:

“Stop-gap measures will be introduced in internal applications released as external applications to address the concerns of those using the external application for purposes to which it was never designed in the first place.”

p.s. Lather, Rinse, Repeat
