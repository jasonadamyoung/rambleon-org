It’s been kind of quiet around these parts for the last week and a half or so, mainly because I’ve been a bit preoccupied with a rather important hardware purchase.

They didn’t really teach this kind of query in any of the CS classes I took, but that’s okay, I only ever plan on doing it once and the answer was “Yes” from the brown eyed girl.

Thankfully she’s a Macintosh user too :-). The only thing I’m wondering about now is whether they allow “Marriage Merging” of one’s iTunes music purchases 😉
