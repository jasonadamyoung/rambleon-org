My productivity has increased measurably since moving the aggregator to the laptop, where itâ€™s not front and center on my desktop computer at work. Only to decrease measurably when it was placed back on the desktop at home.

Thereby this will week will be quite the productive week, as I:

  * turn off the aggregator (or relegate it to the laptop to watch the company feeds)
  * turn off the email

and like it.
