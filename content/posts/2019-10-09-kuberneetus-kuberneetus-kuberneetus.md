Well, clearly, writing about writing doesn&#8217;t make writing happen. So maybe if I just write a _third_ blog post where I utter the word &#8220;kuberneetus&#8221; &#8211; Wilford Brimley&#8217;s ghost will appear out of nowhere and write up my blog post for me.<figure class="wp-block-image">

Well, close.

In my last post, I wrote that the fundamental reason that I have a kubernetes cluster running this blog was that: &#8220;I needed to port an application that I developed from the ground up &#8211; and understand the end-to-end experience as both developer, cluster support, and sysadmin.&#8221;

So I set out to take [an app I have developed over the last several years][1] and that was rebuilt this past year that helps some friends of mine manage a simulation baseball league (and then for good measure [the previous version, which conducts the yearly draft][2] ) and deploy it to the kubernetes cluster.

My secondary goal was when I did a &#8220;git push&#8221; I wanted the application to automatically update.

And that&#8217;s what I have, and I&#8217;ll be exploring in a series of posts over the next few weeks (months, years? undead lifetimes?) &#8211; but here&#8217;s the summary statement:

I&#8217;ve worked out a GitLab CI/CD (emphasis on the **CD** and not the **CI**) automated (using Ansible) deployment of a Ruby on Rails application with persistent storage to a Rancher-based kubernetes cluster. And it&#8217;s all (besides the passwords) [openly available][1] (and [open source][3] for that matter).

And while it&#8217;s worth exploring, and there are some useful ideas for how to go about containerizing an application and deploying it, it&#8217;s definitely not a route that I&#8217;d actually recommend. It was useful for me to get it working as a first step, and it was a useful learning exercise. But it&#8217;s a lot of custom (and for that, it might be a good exercise for legacy monolithic applications and setups that actually need custom).

I had already developed a working docker-based local development process for the application in the last year, replacing a rvm and puma-dev based process that I had in place (well using pow.cx) for years &#8211; based on work that I did for my previous job [way back in 2012][4] (and that maybe deserves its own post in this series). And that I think is where things break down. I was able to do this because I had already invested in docker for that purpose &#8211; and my deployment automation builds on years of Ansible knowledge.

There are much better alternatives emerging. From [OpenFaaS][5] to [Rio][6] (or any of a whole other set of PaaS frameworks being built on kubernetes) &#8211; there&#8217;s a much better future ahead.

But first, ku ber neetle Ã¼s. It&#8217;s showtime!
