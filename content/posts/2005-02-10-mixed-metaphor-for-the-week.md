My mixed metaphor for the week:

> When tech staff, faculty, and others point out that  
> you aren’t wearing any clothes, we too often as humans tell them that they  
> don’t understand the fashion, rather than than stopping to realize that  
> they might just be right, at least a little, and walking with them to the  
> tailor’s shop.
