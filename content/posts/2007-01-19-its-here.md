My new camera â€” a [Nikon D80][1] is here! boy oh boy oh boy do I have a lot to learn, but piddling around the house, Iâ€™ve already been able to take some pictures that I just couldnâ€™t take previously.

I still have yet to master the flash though. Iâ€™m kinda always been scared of flash photography â€” all the pictures I ever take with a flash (admittedly the built-in flashes) stink.

My first public pictures with it are a set of closeups from work. For Christmas, Ben gave us all plastic cowboys and indians and dinosaurs. Because well, it just isnâ€™t Christmas unless you have cowboys and indians and dinosaurs. Each still life is perhaps a glimpse into the psyche of each of its owners (I didnâ€™t check out Rafeâ€™s sculpture â€” Iâ€™ll have to get that one later when heâ€™s in).

Jamesâ€™s â€” is the dinosaur defending or attacking the dad statue? we may never know.

Danielâ€™s â€” rather narrow ledge there â€” which way is the dinosaur going?

Aaronâ€™s â€” sssh â€” donâ€™t tell PETA. Or the society for the preservation of plastic carnivorous tyrannosaurs â€” and whatâ€™s up with the triceratops joining in with the plasmans?

Suzanneâ€™s â€” this is a bit chaotic. Perhaps the most poignant illustration of war:

Mine â€” stalemate at the J-A-Y corral

Kevinâ€™s : the donkeyâ€™s stare makes the picture ([better large][12]) (and NO, thatâ€™s not a commentary on my boss ðŸ˜‰ )
