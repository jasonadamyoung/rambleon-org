I ended 2010 and started 2011 with something a little different â€” playing around with [Gource][1] â€” a tool for visualizing version control logs.

While it seems most of the adventure was managing to get the things converted to video and uploaded somewhere.

I finally managed to do that, thanks to [Dan-O for the Creative Commons Attribution music][2], [Sound Studio 4][3] (from the [Indie Mac Gift Pack][4]) for trimming it up, QuickTime (after installing 7 from the Snow Leopard DVD and resurrecting my QuickTime Pro License) for combining video and music â€” and finally [SmugMug][5] for hosting ad-free, non-YouTube trashed versions of the files â€” I bring to you a yearâ€™s worth of commits to the [darmok project][6] thatâ€™s part of my work at NC State and [eXtension][7].

Not content to stop there â€” I wondered what [another little project I worked on this year][9] would look like, especially given a run-up to a [the big release of a major rewrite][10]

Hereâ€™s how it looked over the first 9 months of 2010:

And finally hereâ€™s some more fun thanks to [the gource custom log support][12] â€” a dayâ€™s worth of data for the last day of 2010 at [trixietracker][13]:

I love data. Totally looking forward to playing with [logstalgia][15] next ðŸ™‚
