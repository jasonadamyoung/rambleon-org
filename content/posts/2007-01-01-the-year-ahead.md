I’m a notoriously reflective person — so I’m fighting every last tendency I have to write a “year in review” post. But as my father always said while I was growing up:

> Whatsa behinda me, donta bother me

My dad is as southern as I am — but his put-on italian is much better than mine.

I’m not a betting man, but I sure do propose wagers a fair amount ( “I’d bet money that…” or “I’m not a betting man, but I’d wager that…” ) — which might explain that I lose every time I actually bet on anything (note to the I.R.S — not that I ever do that) — so it’s not like I can make any prognostications on what will actually happen in 2007. So I won’t. Maybe I’ll just talk about what I hope to see in the upcoming 525,600 minutes of 2007. (there, stuck the song in yer head didn’t I?)

The Wife and I Buy a House

I currently own a townhome-looking-condo. It’s nice enough, but both she and I are looking for something to call _ours_, with a porch, and a deck, and a yard. I haven’t cut grass in 10 years, but I’m actually looking forward to it. Watch for the 2008 year ahead post wherein I yearn for making everything in the yard a natural area.

And a dog. Yes a dog. Maybe two.

The Wife and I Get a Dog

Had to say it twice for good measure.

I implement OpenID somewhere/anywhere

OpenID is important — in ways everyone can appreciate, but only can be explained to geeks (although I have an awful lot of starred items in Google Reader that I haven’t bothered reading yet that might explain it to non-geeks). I also need to implement it because I plan on presenting about it in June. You might think that presenting it will make me learn it well enough to explain to someone else. Nope. It’s all about implementation.

Work

I’m not sure what to say about this one. My job and the things that I do in my job take up the majority of my time — and so how well it goes or doesn’t go affects other areas of my life disproportionately. Maybe that’s the hope for 2007 — keep work from affecting everything else more than it should.

At the very least, I want to do something _interesting_ — somewhere something related to xmpp, aggregation, openid, maybe even second life. We have a fair number of spare cycles on our servers, and I’d like to take advantage of those with little things that get a good return (because I don’t have all that many spare cycles).

Was that all sufficiently vague enough?

10 years

February will mark my 10 year (work) anniversary with the University. I’m sure I’ll come up with something sappingly reflective by then.

My new camera and lens gets here

I’m finally taking the leap into the DSLR world. It’s not like my abilities eclipse any of the cameras I have now, but I am seeing the limits of the lenses I have in them (and the fact that I drink too much caffeine). I haven’t been excited about photography in a long time. But I’ve spent more time in Flickr — just on the _idea_ of the camera and lens (a great lens, a really, really great lens) coming. I’m excited. And I don’t get excited very easily at all.

I write something vaguely funny again

Not that my sarcasm isn’t completely wasted on my co-workers, but it’s been [far too long][1] since I’ve written anything that’s even remotely related to funny. And my job needs funny, a whole lot of funny.

I get completely tired of all the “Double-Oh-Seven” Jokes

If I were a betting man, I’d definitely wager that’s happened already.

Happy new year. Hope 1, Furies 0. Film at 11.
