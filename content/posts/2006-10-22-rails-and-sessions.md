of URL’s I need to read tomorrow (and have our devs read)

Can you guess one of the problems we are facing? (hint, filesystem/pstore based sessions are really cool &#8211; until they aren’t)

  * [Using memcached for Ruby on Rails session storage][1]
  * [Sessions N Such][2]
  * [HowtoChangeSessionStore][3]
  * [Memcached][4]

At the moment, I’m partial toward [Roll your own SQL session store][5]
