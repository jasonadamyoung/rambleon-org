So, I’m not all that upset personally that [Leopard was delayed until October][1] I really didn’t want to worry with it at work — and this further delays the pressure on my strong desire to get a new home computer.

Apple also published a [KB article][2] on parental controls in Dictionary.app to prevent “profanity” from showing up in Dictionary.

Coincidence? For a bunch of indie software developers — I think not 😉
