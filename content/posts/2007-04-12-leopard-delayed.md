So, I‚Äôm not all that upset personally that [Leopard was delayed until October][1] I really didn‚Äôt want to worry with it at work &#8211; and this further delays the pressure on my strong desire to get a new home computer.

Apple also published a [KB article][2] on parental controls in Dictionary.app to prevent ‚Äúprofanity‚Äù from showing up in Dictionary.

Coincidence? For a bunch of indie software developers &#8211; I think not üòâ
