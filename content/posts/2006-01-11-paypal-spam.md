The paypal spammers are getting good:

A professional looking clip art graphic, use of “case id’s” And the writing is almost getting better.

> It has come to our attention that your PayPal Billing Information. Failure to update your records will result in account termination. Please update your records in maximum 72 hours. Once you have updated them, your PayPal session will not be interrupted and will continue as normal. Failure to update them will result in cancellation of service, Terms of Service (TOS) violations or future billing problems.

Of course they can’t quite fake all the headers yet:

> From: update@paypal.com Subject: Please update your PayPal account ! Date: January 11, 2006 5:04:20 PM EST Return-Path: … Received: from redakcja.trybuna.com.pl (unknown [212.160.141.120]) by mail.extension.org (Postfix) with ESMTP id 719403FF83D for ; Wed, 11 Jan 2006 17:07:30 -0500 (EST) Received: by redakcja.trybuna.com.pl (Postfix, from userid 1035) id 648541578837; Wed, 11 Jan 2006 23:04:20 +0100 (CET)

And of course, I’m not running Windows, or an Internet Explorer-based email client or even Internet Explorer (even if VMWare wants me too 😉 ) — so I don’t an an obfuscated URL yet — and can tell that:

> http://rootimage.com/.secured/updates/us/webscr.php?cmd=LogIn

is definitely not paypal.com.

But they are getting much better. I feel sorry for the folks that fall for it. (maybe they’ll find this in google and won’t).
