So I just spent about 15 minutes trying to troubleshoot why my fledgling jabber2 install wasnâ€™t working. Even to the point of breaking out ethereal to sniff the traffic and triple checking my iptables rules.

Then it dawned on that I failed to move the CNAME I was using to the server that jabber2 was actually installed on.
