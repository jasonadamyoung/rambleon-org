If you are reading this, you undoubtedly know that [a fellow going by the alias ‘The Pirate Captain’][1] won the NC State Student Body President this week.

I’m a staff member at NCSU, in computing, and I have nothing to do with Student Development, Student Government, or really any student organization at all (I interact with the [PackMUG][2] and provide a [webserver][3] for Engineering student groups — but that’s it), so I have no influence or role or anything else in student elections. And besides, the election is said and done. I also don’t know Whil at all.

But I think what he did was great. I’m sure those that know me at NC State would not be surprised. I’m a big fan of those that epitomize the words from Apple Computer’s late 90’s “Think Different” marketing campaign:

> _Here’s to the crazy ones,  
> the misfits,  
> the rebels,  
> the troublemakers.  
> The round pegs in the square holes.  
> The ones who see things differently._
> 
> They’re not fond of rules  
> and they have no respect for the status quo.
> 
> You can quote them,  
> disagree with them,  
> glorify or vilify them.  
> About the only thing you can’t do  
> is ignore them,  
> because they change things.  
> They push the human race forward.
> 
> And while some may see them as the crazy ones,  
> we see genius.
> 
> Because the people who are crazy enough to  
> think they can change the world  
> are the ones who do.

> Think Different.

He energized the student population, creating a student voter turnout that was higher (26-27%) than it has been in years. He created a ongoing debate and discussion about the role of student government. And he showed that one guy, even with a merry band of followers, can change things. I think NC State is much the better for students (and faculty/staff) like Whil.

I’m excited to see how he’ll work through what undoubtedly will be a tough road in some places ahead. An awful lot of people don’t like to see the status quo messed with. But I think he’ll do great.

Good Luck Captain.
