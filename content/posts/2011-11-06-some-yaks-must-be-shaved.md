Today, my [first-ever stack overflow][1] question about tracing ruby dependencies/requires was still stuck in my crawl, even though the actual problem was long since solved.

Because, the core of all learning starts with one of two things: either a question or the internal drive of _there has to be a better way_

And sometimes in the journey of finding a better way, you find there isn’t. But the journey is almost always interesting, and in my career, I’ve found that journey to be critical to continually learning new things.

So [I figured something out][2].

Is it worthwhile? For the world? no, not really. But it was for me.

I think [Joi Ito][3] describes it best (and well enough it deserved a  [citation on the wikitionary page][4]) &#8211; but I’ll summarize:

Some Yaks Must Be Shaved.
