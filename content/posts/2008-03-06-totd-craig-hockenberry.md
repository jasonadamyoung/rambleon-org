[Twitter of the Day][1] from [Craig Hockenberry][2], while following the iPhone Dev event:

> I bet it’s quiet in the Android offices right about now…

Note, at the time I write this Apple hasn’t said yet how/if they’ll control distribution. The dev tools will kick butt, but that distribution control may be the Android advantage.

Interesting, very interesting, times ahead.
