Reading man pages is like eating spinach. Good for you, even if you hate it.

Like all good Macintosh users, I stick with the default bash shell, but one of its default features, I absolutely despise — the [bleeping] beeping when you are lazy and want path completion, even when there are multiple items that match what you are trying to match.

After doing this before, and completely forgetting how, and neglecting to put it in my weblog, I finally gave up and grep’d through the bash man page — where lo and behold — I found that creating a ~/.inputrc with the lines:

<code class="highlighter-rouge">set bell-style none set show-all-if-ambiguous On</code>

has now made me a happy(ier) man. No more [bleeping] beeping terminal because I’m too lazy to type out the full names of things.
