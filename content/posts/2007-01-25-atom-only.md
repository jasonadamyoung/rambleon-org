The [continued lack of Atom 1.0 in wordpress][1] reminded me that my feeds were most likely shifted back to RSS2 due to the politics of the wordpress leaders — and recent upgrades and me not paying attention.

Thanks to [this plugin][2] for making it easier.

If any of the estimated 6.5 readers of the blog have their feed readers broken — get a new feed reader.

p.s. See also [Shelley’s post][3] — with the appropriate quote:

> There’s nothing like syndication to bring out the schoolyard in supposedly reasonable adults. I don’t think even the “vi versus emacs” wars compare.

Internet Jerry Springer. I’ve said it multiple times.
