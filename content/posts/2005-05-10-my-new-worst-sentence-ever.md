From a thread on a campus mailing list.

![stengel][1]

> If I feel, in my professional judgment, that the question is going to be misinterpreted or answered incorrectly or caught in a support loop with the helpdesk because there are mitigating circumstances that we are aware of, but is hard for a campus wide helpdesk having to answer (by necessity) in a generic fashion to understand, then we aren’t going through the helpdesk, or sending users to it.

Good Grief. I am a blathering idiot at times.

Casey Stengel, eat your heart out.

Though after today, this quote is fitting:

_The key to being a good manager is keeping the people who hate me away from those who are still undecided. &#8211; Casey Stengel_

[Followup] I ended up apologizing for the ramblings on the list, comparing myself to subject of life in MacBeth’s soliloquy &#8211; “full of sound and fury, signifying nothing” Only, I attributed the soliloquy to Hamlet. Which led in turn to another followup and correction. Some weeks it doesn’t pay to get out of bed.
