You know‚Ä¶

Adobe has gotten a lot of flack about the whole ‚Äúwe won‚Äôt be Universal until CS3‚Äù thing. And I for one, think Adobe deserves a lot of flack about a lot of things‚Ä¶.

But not about this.

Good grief, switching from Metrowerks to XCode has to be a _bear_

And you know, for the first time in Adobe‚Äôs **history** ‚Äî they seem to be dealing with this [pretty openly][1]

So cut them some slack, and get ready to watch Photoshop kick butt on the Intel Desktops Apple better announce at WWDC üôÇ
