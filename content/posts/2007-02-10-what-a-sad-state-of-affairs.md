I read the opening paragraph of [this joke quoted from Phil Windley][1]. And while readying the first paragraph, I started getting my dander up because I thought it might actually be a real life occurrence.

How sad is that that arresting someone at the airport with a ruler, protractor, set square, slide rule, and calculator could be completely plausible?

That said, if you like cheesy high school math humor (of which I do) &#8211; youâ€™ll like the joke ðŸ™‚

p.s. In almost, but largely completely un-, related links &#8211; you too can [save boston from offensive lite brites][2]
