The fact that you create <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/.gem</code> and stick a <code class="highlighter-rouge">source_cache</code> file in there pisses me off royally.

This made me curse you bitterly today. And made Daniel and James laugh at me for doing so.

Of course that made me laugh, but thatâ€™s beside the point. I still dislike you royally.

Just want you to know, Jay
