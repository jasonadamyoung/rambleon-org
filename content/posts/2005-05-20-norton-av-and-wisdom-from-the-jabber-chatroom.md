  <code class="highlighter-rouge">2:43:55 PM jayoung@jabber.eos.ncsu.edu: Norton AV 10 for the Macintosh is still a pile of not very pleasant stuff  2:44:35 PM jayoung@jabber.eos.ncsu.edu: for a forced "security" piece of software, you'd really expect a much better engineered product  2:44:49 PM jayoung@jabber.eos.ncsu.edu: 1145 lines written to the console log during liveupdate  2:45:51 PM [peer]: my personal favorite item of hatred is the scan on mount thingy  2:46:49 PM jayoung@jabber.eos.ncsu.edu: no, no, what's worse (at least pre 10, don't know about 10 yet) - is the fact that NAV+the Finder (another pile of not very pleasant stuff) won't let go of usb memory keys when you want to eject them  2:46:55 PM jayoung@jabber.eos.ncsu.edu: at least that's my theory  2:47:10 PM jayoung@jabber.eos.ncsu.edu: I can't eject squat with NAV liveprotect running without killing the Finder  </code>

Obviously, I have a few issues with Norton AntiVirus. Iâ€™ll never run it at home, ever.
