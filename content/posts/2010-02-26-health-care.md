Whatever your believe on the health care debate &#8211; you owe it to ourself to watch this:

The [text is here][1]. I don’t know if it is as compelling as the video.

I watch it and my blood boils at the damage and destruction to reasonable discourse resulting from the “death panel” comments that Sarah Palin and others made. This is fundamentally why I’ll never vote republican again at the national level as long as people like her, and other obstructionists purely in it for their own gain are anywhere near the GOP. I don’t know that the democrats are all that much better in many areas, but right here in this one, the activities of the republicans are completely shameful.

Pass the damn bill. No it’s not perfect, nothing ever is, but we have to start making steps for health and insurance reform. Pass the damn bill.
