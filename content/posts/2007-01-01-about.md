This site exists because people are funny and life is supposed to be funny.

Parody, satire, and humor are core values to the human experience.

And so are dinosaurs.

And plastic.

(man, this intro so needs theme music)

Actually this site exists to give me an outlet to be marginally funny.

The key word is “marginally”

A big thanks to Ben MacNeill for the initial gift of the dinosaurs. And for James for making me register the domain name before he did and became a domain squatter and making me go to some group of lawyers with legal pads and labeled folders to take it back from him.

And thanks to organizations everywhere (including mine) and all the content running over the series of tubes we call the Internet for the ongoing inspiration. You guys rock!

(Hello Wisconsin!)

(whoops, wrong ending credits — we’ll get that corrected shortly)
