Warning, the man curses about as much as I do, but he’s damn straight right [about programmers needing to get statistics][1]

I’d just be glad if they actually understood the scientific method.

best line of the whole article:

_If you want to measure something, then don’t measure other shit._

I think I’m even more impressed with [mongrel][2] now. What can I say, I appreciate a well written rant.

I’m not quite into reading [R programming][3] books for fun (sorry Kevin) &#8211; but I might spend some time with it to start getting some performance and interesting stats out of our logs.
