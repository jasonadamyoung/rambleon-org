It&#8217;s been a while – over 3 years – [since I last officially rambled][1] on at &#8220;rambleon.org&#8221; and after some machination that deserve its own post, the summer solstice finds me posting here again, with old posts &#8211; and even posts at what was my &#8220;home&#8221; site at littleriverview.org mixed in.

I can&#8217;t guarantee that time won&#8217;t find me again posting again six months from now, at the next [winter solstice][2]. But it seems time again to return a bit to all the things that made rambleon, well, [rambly][3], [nerdy][4], [funny][5], and maybe even sometimes [poignant][6]

In the meantime, there&#8217;s lot of history here, and a whole lot of broken links, and weird formatting that has creeped in my wordpress-to-octopress-to-jekyll-to-wordpress transition, so consider it to be web [wabi-sabi][7] and take with that the joy therein.
