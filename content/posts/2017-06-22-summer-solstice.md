It's been a while – over 3 years – [since I last officially rambled][1] on at "rambleon.org" and after some machination that deserve its own post, the summer solstice finds me posting here again, with old posts — and even posts at what was my "home" site at littleriverview.org mixed in.

I can't guarantee that time won't find me again posting again six months from now, at the next [winter solstice][2]. But it seems time again to return a bit to all the things that made rambleon, well, [rambly][3], [nerdy][4], [funny][5], and maybe even sometimes [poignant][6]

In the meantime, there's lot of history here, and a whole lot of broken links, and weird formatting that has creeped in my wordpress-to-octopress-to-jekyll-to-wordpress transition, so consider it to be web [wabi-sabi][7] and take with that the joy therein.
