Billy [already mentioned this][1] but it deserved repeating.

If you have anything to do with Windows Support, you should be reading [Mark Russinovich’s Sysinternals weblog][2].

And if it’s over your head (and parts at least are likely going to be) &#8211; then dig into the article and figure out what it is saying. Articles like the [Explorer Registry Polling][3] and Mark’s troubleshooting process give you a glimpse of how components are tied together in Windows.

While I (thankfully) don’t have a daily frustration with Windows and Windows programming anymore (now that I’m becoming a manager with a macintosh) &#8211; Mark and Bryce’s work at Sysinternals was instrumental in helping me understand more about Windows architecture &#8211; which in turn helped me write things like the infamous NCSUGINA, and more, understand how to troubleshoot Windows and Windows applications as a system administrator &#8211; much better than I ever would have just dealing with things at the surface/observational levels.

You’re cheating yourself and the folks you support if you don’t learn about some of these details. Heck, I still read it and I don’t plan on (personally) using Windows as a system admin ever again, except to check websites under IE.
