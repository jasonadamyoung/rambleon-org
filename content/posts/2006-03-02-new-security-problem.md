So I go to the NCSU Gym today — where I’m greeted with a flyer on the locker room door that reads:

“The Hot Water will be secured on Friday March 3, 2006 for maintenance”

I didn’t realize that there was a security issue with hot water. I wonder if the DHS has changed the security threat level.

(obviously IT people aren’t the only ones that can’t communicate)
