2:00pm and all is well &#8211; even with slight temptations from Kevin Gamble and Jason Corley

There is some debate however, about snide comments and whether those constitute implicit complaints or not. I have avoided those just to be safe.

Also, the jury is out to whether causing snide comments in others implies some complaint culpability. Sadly, I have not avoided that.

However, I have not announced the existence of this day in the Engineering System Administrator’s chatroom, out of fear that the challenge to make me complain would be too great, especially for Billy Beaudoin.
