![timemachine.png][1]I did my first TimeMachine restore today. I tried out Firefox 3 Beta 1 — and decided that _I_ wasn’t quite ready for it. So I restored my Firefox Profile from this morning before I downloaded and started running FF3. Click the TimeMachine icon, pick the date/time, navigate to the folder, click restore. And voila! it worked. It actually worked. And it prompted me if I wanted to replace the current profile directory or keep both.

That might have been the easiest restore on any platform I’ve ever done.
