After seeing [Anne’s Twitter about problems at the Georgia Dome][1] — I turned to Google wondering what might be going on. I wondered if this was some current event, or like, maybe issues with the facility itself being talked about during the basketball game there.

The [Wikipedia article for the Georgia Dome][2] **ALREADY HAD INFORMATION ABOUT THIS:**

> March 14, 2008 Storm

A storm blew through the downtown Atlanta area during the 2008 SEC Men’s Basketball Tournament causing some damage to the dome. The storm occured during the overtime of the Mississippi State/Alabama quarterfinal game and stopped play.

I can’t find anything about this in the major media outlets online. Clearly a potential tornado that damages a building holding thousands of people in a sporting event should be news right?

But Google is beginning to find comments in weather forums, and links to some [local media outlets (and their blogs!)][3] with the story.

Moral of the story? User-generated content (and corroboration from local news outlets, utilizing modern tools) wins again. In short order, Twitter, Google, and Wikipedia, combined with local media give me a picture of what’s happening at the Georgia Dome, faster, and more accurately, than any major media outlet.

I bet there are flickr pictures and twitters from people actually there too that won’t take long to find.
