so the complaint embargo for Thursday is done too &#8211; that’s mostly Aaron’s fault for saying he was going to fix the faq.extension-slated-for-deprecation-any-day-now tool, which I had already fixed, but that wasn’t my complaint. My complaint was why I had to fix it in the first place and something about inabilities vis-a-vis typing URLs into a browser. But that’s neither here nor there.

So I’ve decided that Scott Adams is my blogisherpa. I don’t really have heroes &#8211; other than my Dad, and Lou Gehrig and Jackie Robinson, so I can’t really call him a hero. And I’m exorbitantly wary of following anyone and I rarely have much respect for authority, so I can’t really call him a leader, or a thought leader, or any other post-millenial buzzword bingo winners.

So he’s my blogisherpa. My guide to writing long rambly articles that almost don’t, but do seem to make sense. Like his [timely][1] advice about [wedding costs][2] or even better, giving voice to the theories of [Ignorantselfishertarianism][3]

New complaint &#8211; I just finished my McDonald’s coffee and apparently got the bottom of the pot. I was wondering why my coffee was grainy all of a sudden.
