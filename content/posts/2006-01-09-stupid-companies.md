So I’ve been having this on-again, off-again debate with myself regarding [Xen][1] and [VMWare’s ESX Server][2]. The project I’m working on is lending itself to using virtualization for some of our web sites, and while we have a small installation, there’s a big potential that that solutions in this space that we come up with will influence the entire University Extension System.

I tried Xen, and it’s still a bit “geeky” to configure. I want something that is a little easier to get up and running and configure. So I wanted to download VMWare ESX server.

Well, that’d be great **but I can’t get past their new customer registration form because it requires freakin’ internet explorer!**

(sorry, this is going to break the look and feel for the site, because the graphics are too large for the post area, but I didn’t want to shrink the graphics)

Here’s the bottom of the form in firefox:

And when you submit the form (“Continue”) &#8211; you get various errors about information missing.

Here’s the bottom of the form in IE.

Because I can’t submit a simple web form from the browser and platform I use? VMWare, I think you just lost yourself a potential customer and probably several others if I have anything to say about it and you don’t fix problems like this. And if you can’t get a cross-browser web form right in 2006, I don’t trust that you can get a system-level virtualization product right.

([p.s.] I probably shouldn’t have violated my own rule to not post when I’m extremely annoyed with something or someone (which I violate all the time and I need to stop doing so) But I’m really, really, hoping this lights a fire under someone’s keester at the company. Thankfully for VMware, I probably don’t have enough Google Rank to do that and have this actually go anywhere)

([p.p.s] I’m calmed down now. I’m still annoyed, but this whole note is overly hyperbolic when reading it with calmer eyes. I’m leaving it for posterity though)

([p.p.p.s] A VMWare rep did comment here (I mailed the link to this article to their sales division) &#8211; which was a good PR move. Thanks for the comment, I do very much appreciate that)
