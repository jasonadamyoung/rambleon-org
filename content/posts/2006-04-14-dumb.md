As usual, bureacratic lack of thinking is not limited to Tuttle. As the third-grader [that wrote Apple][1] can attest.

At least Apple apologized. Corporations do that when they think the stock price will tank. Government organizations rarely do that though.

(p.s. this is what happens when you let process, and not thinking and humanity run the show. )
