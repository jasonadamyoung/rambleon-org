So for the first time that I can recall — I actually wanted to listen to an audio clip of an interview at NPR. You see, I like my web in text. But I do typically like NPR and wanted to hear [Scott Simon interview Andy Griffith][1]

But NPR, while [they apparently get the podcasts right][2] — don’t get the clips in their news articles right. I have to have Real or Windows Media — and choosing between either for a Macintosh user is like choosing between a punch to the gut or a boot in the arse.

Needless to say, I won’t be listening.
