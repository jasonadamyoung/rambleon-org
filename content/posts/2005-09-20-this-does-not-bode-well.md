So this morning I download the new Backup version 3 application that comes with my .Mac account. I use Backup at home, and it works &#8211; but only if you never let the Backup log get too big (like more than a few days).

I’m hoping that Backup 3 fixes that &#8211; and wanted to see what it looked like in the office.

Somehow a blank “keychain access” dialog doesn’t bode well

**[update]:** for the record, running it the second time resulted in a keychain access dialog with the text and buttons that you’d expect in it. It’s more superstition than anything else 🙂
