You know, on both my business cards, and [on the staff site][1] &#8211; I’m listed as the “Systems Engineer” for eXtension. (or “Senior Systems Engineer” &#8211; but the people working in IT in eXtension started dropping all the “Seniors” with our titles when it seemed like everything and everyone in eXtension was a “Senior something” or a “Blah Leader” &#8211; it just sounded… well, it didn’t sound right)

But I’m not a [Systems Engineer][2]. I grok the [discipline of Systems Engineering][3] &#8211; probably way more than any normal Tom, Dick, or Harry that calls themselves Systems Engineer. But as a Computer Science graduate, and having worked in an Academic institution where I do actually believe that words matter &#8211; I’m not a Systems Engineer. I haven’t gone through any of the [Academic Programs][4] (which, by the way, run the gambit of disciplines &#8211; e.g. see UVA’s [list of disciplines][5]). And while I wouldn’t really think I’d have to do that if I was actually doing Systems Engineering &#8211; I’m not even doing that. (and part of me wonders if I’m supposed to be doing that 😉 ).

I really am more the Systems Manager. I think I’m probably going to go change the labels on the staff pages for a while.
