_In which I don't talk about Kuberneetus like the last three posts to avoid writing up things about kubernetes â€” I just avoid writing up things about kubernetes, well mostly._

  
[Simon Willison][1] is one of the developers that I've admired for years, and have followed his work off and mostly on every since I came across his work on pingback and xml-rpc back when I did PHP (way, way back in the early aught's). I've got a stack of stars about a mile long in my feed reader starring all his work with sqlite tools and especially [Datasette][2] â€” which is something that I haven't been able to integrate into my day job(s) â€” and I keep wanting to clear the decks to make time for in the hobby space.

A few weeks ago, Simon did another thing that I am going to try to emulate â€” [he's started writing weeknotes][3] (he links to [more information here][4] )

It's just a great idea, if only for myself, to be able to look back and see some progression (or regression) in the work that I do.

I didn't start a post of notes last week, so this first one of mine is going to be a bit stilted most likely, but we'll see how it goes.

<hr class="wp-block-separator" />

I hold a lot of stress/tension in my neck, which comes up and haunts me sometimes, I ended up getting a fairly severe muscle cramp (what I would have called/do call "pulling a muscle" before I learned better) â€” enough that it knocked me out of the commute into work. I was able to work from home that day though, and worked on a Bash script. That might not be the best idea for a cure for a muscle cramp ðŸ˜‰

One of our WordPress multisite platforms is available for students and organizations and has been self-serve for years, and has built up somewhere north of 15,000 idle blogs/sites. My colleagues that do the actual WordPress work (I am responsible for the web platforms themselves) are cleaning those out, and worked on a process to identify and flag those blogs as deleted (WordPress has a deleted flag that will 404 the site, but leave all the tables and content). We have a Jenkins platform already in place that's running some scripts (typically all Bash) that deploy the site and do things like run the `wp-cli` tool to rewrite urls when needed. Since that's the model, I went with it, and ended up writing a Jenkins-executed Bash script to use `wp-cli` to query the database for all the blogs flagged as deleted, dump them to a file and loop over them at 2,000 an hour to remove.

In between Google Searches and Bash Heredoc games, I upgraded my personal iMac to Catalina. I think it would have been straightforward if I had better than 6.0Mbps DSL and a slow 2TB spinning disk in the iMac, it was pretty rough around the edges for sure. But it eventually settled out.

I upgraded my work Macbook to Catalina the next day without much event other than all the Windows Vista-esque permission prompts for Documents, Downloads and notification access.

Sometime last month, we had some accounts get created in our GitLab platform(s) with the wrong UID â€” so I spent some time trying to debug where that might have gone off the rails. We implemented signed/encrypted SAML â€” so I can't get the attributes that were returned from Shibboleth in the logs easily. While [OneLogin has a SAML decryptor][5] tool â€” it's online only, and well, no private keys are getting pasted there, so I looked into what it would take to write a (non-Java, preferably python) tool to do it locally â€” with some leads, but no end-success other than to realize the labor effort probably isn't worth it, and I just need to spend some time with a non-encrypted dev box to work out where things went wrong with the uid value.

In kubernetes news, [Rancher 2.3 was released][6] â€” so both my homelab cluster and my Kuberneetus/KuberneetleÃ¼s cluster were updated. And it just worked (which is definitely more than I can say for every OpenShift upgrade I've watched, or the ones I attempted last fall in the homelab)

Friday I ended up needing to take a leave day and go out of town for a bit â€” so there wasn't anything work or hobby wise that came up then, but on the way back, I did on a spur of the moment suddenly decide that it was time to upgrade my iPhone â€” so I swung by the Apple store, and worked through that, where again the curse of 6.0Mbps DSL in trying to download a 3.2GB iOS update, and some untold gigabytes of app re-downloads stretched that whole process over 5 hours. But the low-light photo options are pretty amazing.

So, yeah a bit stilted â€” but maybe that's appropriate for update week.  
  
I've got better notes to start this week on â€” and it's likely going to be all about "JupyterHub" this week, which honestly I'm fairly excited about.
