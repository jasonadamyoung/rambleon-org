I was responding to a colleague today after he mentioned that every child of the 60’s wanted to be a gun fighter after watching _Shane_ that I was a child of the 70’s (well the 70’s-80’s being born in ‘73). My only television role models were John Travolta, Luke Skywalker, The Greatest American Hero, and the A-Team.

I guess that meant I wanted to grow up to be a disco-dancing, force-wielding, wrongly-convicted, problem-solving teacher that wore pajamas every day given to him by aliens.

I guess I made that dream happen by getting into computing.
