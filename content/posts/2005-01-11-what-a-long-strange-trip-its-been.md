So it’s been a while since I’ve posted. Maybe I should resolve &#8211; after all the New Year’s resolutions have passed &#8211; to write more here. After a day’s worth of emails though, somehow the words just don’t quite come as easily.

School started back today, thankfully we are bit isolated from that in my group at the University. The pressure on others around us goes up a bit, which means our pressure goes up a bit, but other than that, things seem to be moving along well.

I have a lot of things relevant to post in _BinaryPage_ &#8211; so maybe we’ll get to them over the next several days. This includes some commentary on Norton Antivirus for the Macintosh (some not very nice commentary), happenings in storage around the University and how it affects us, comments on new and updated recommended applications for Macintosh OS X, I really want to follow up with the campus paper that came out of the academic side of IT at NC State (called [Layer 8][1]) with my own little treatise on the matter called “Layer 10” &#8211; which talks about how you build innovation into an organization, and why really successful business plans have innovation at their core, and why most people don’t seem to get that.

A little Perl, a little PHP, a lot Macintosh, and a whole lot of communication and cat herding. Such is 2005 in the land of a University System Admin.

Happy New (School) Year.
