Little things matter.

And so does understanding and being able to work through the “little things” — trying to instill that, and to educate, and to remind the advanced staff of the fundamentals, and to provide those fundamentals to new staff, is a passion of mine.

So I [created a quiz][1] for our helpdesk and peer staff. For all 1.5 readers of this blog. Feel free to play along with the home game by [mailing me][2] your answers.

Now what remains to be seen is the response rate I’ll get. Typically, this is dismal. Everyone wants “education” — they rarely want to make the effort to receive it.
