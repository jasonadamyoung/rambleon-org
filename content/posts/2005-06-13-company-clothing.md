[Kevin Briody][1]’s post reminded me of one of the best reasons to work at a University, especially one’s Alma Matter.

I remember when I (briefly, thankfully) worked for CompuCom that I had at least two week’s worth of CompuCom logo clothing and other vendor clothing after just 6 months on the job. The CompuCom clothing became pretty useless after I left there.

And that may be the greatest part about working for one’s Alma Matter, the company clothing never really goes out of style.

(okay, except for the University’s “three wet rats” logo, which thankfully does not appear to be licensed anymore)
