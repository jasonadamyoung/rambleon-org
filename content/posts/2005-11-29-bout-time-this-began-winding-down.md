Hi,

Last week you expressed interest in participating in our research team. Did you forget about this appealing job offer? You are one of the few students who did not register for our program! There are only a few vacant positions left and you will miss your chance for a great job.

You can benefit from our promotion and become a member for the incredible one-time membership fee of only $10! Most of our Members earn from $650 to $850 per week. The more experienced ones earn above $900! A training program and special bonuses are available upon signing up and will increase your earnings.

Hello Dr. Johnson!

It’s so good to hear from you. I have great news! Timmy is getting much better! And my dad’s boss, Mr. Ebenezer has apparently come into a large sum of money from a royal family overseas! Mr. Ebenezer was so overjoyed at the news that he gave my dad a big bonus and brought Timmy a “Knows Your Name” Elmo to the hospital on Thanksgiving where we all feasted on turkey-flavored Spam and gelled cranberry sauce from the hospital cafeteria. Oh happy day!

I still might be interested. There are some loose ends that I’d like to clear up though.

You’ve sent me mail from multiple addresses:

linda.johnson794011470@thbglobal.com lindaj794011470@associate-support.com ljohnson794011470@associate-support.com

Why did you do that? Most faculty I know only have one email address that they use for corresponding with their students.

You never told me what University you work at. Or what your Ph.D. is in

And your response to my last note really confused me:

> There<code class="highlighter-rouge">s nothing to be sceptical about- more than 10 000 people have already ta &gt; ken advantage of our services. Don</code>t let someone else take your place.

I thought this was just a research team for NC State University?!? That’s a lot of people on your team. Is ‘sceptical’ a particular research term? I’m not sure of the definition of that.

Thanks! Jason
