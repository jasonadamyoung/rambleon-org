I stay logged in to my Macintosh at home and have it sync to .Mac every hour, and have my desktop Mac at work to sync to .Mac every hour, and every so often my laptop too. So I’ve come to expect the occassional sync services error message about conflicts.

Weyahl, I came home tonight to this error message on my computer.

![ConflictResolver][1]

Which might very well be the greatest error message ever.

**[correction]** Greatest error _dialog_ might be more accurate. **[update]** It’s not as funny as I thought it was when I posted it to the University’s packmug list, but it’s still kinda funny.
