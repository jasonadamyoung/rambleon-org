These are your heroes, from [the affidavit][1] (pdf, [via wired][2]), Brian Lam, editor for Gizmodo in a letter to the Apple CEO:

> P.S. I hope you take it easy on the kid who lost it. I don’t think he loves anything more than Apple except, well, beer. Maybe some spankings.

I don’t like Apple’s secrecy, I don’t like them influencing law enforcement divisions that have cops busting down the doors of people’s homes and taking all their computing equipment over a stupid phone.

But these people aren’t journalists. They are little boys who find themselves with a platform for wrecking other people’s lives.
