[Over one year later][1], I’m still waiting for Leopard…

My Dual-G4 model was introduced over 5 years ago now, and it’s about 4.5 years old for me (I bought it in Feb 2003, right after it was discontinued in favor of the FW800 model). I’m so ready for a new home desktop computer.

Please hurry up Apple.
