So the TextMate Halloween theme has more than a few people [bent out of shape, whilst others like it][1]

For my part, I just got a bit tired of it after a day. But I can replace my own Macintosh application resources while I wait for a patch.

The best part, though, is that I managed to discover that TextMate has themes (because I failed to do what should be required of every Macintosh application owner â€” explore the preferences).

And better yet, a colleague of mine in North Carolina [did his own theme][2]

I like it.
