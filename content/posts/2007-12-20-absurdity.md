We live in an absurd society where a companyâ€™s plans to ramp up production on machine Y of widget X by 17% is considered far more confidential than all my purchases of widget X and my purchasing information. IT groups bend over backwards to try to address the former and a lot less to address the latter.

Something is seriously wrong with the people running Information Technology in these organizations.

They must have learned how to do IT from Michigan State or they read Michael Krigsman columns in ZDNet.
