Sigh. I need to stop [reading Slashdot][2]. I usually manage to be good, and click “Mark all as Read” for their feed.

However, I made the mistake of reading and finding out that [MySQL A.B. has partnered with SCO][3]

I think it’s time to move everything to PostgreSQL.

(_actually probably not, I just wanted an excuse to post the darlman graphic and complain a little. Now if MySQL A.B. goes so far as to call the GPL unconstitutional, then I’m going to have some issues_)
