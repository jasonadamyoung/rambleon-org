> To: [steering group members] Subject: (fwd) Sysadm meeting

We won’t be meeting this month prior to the sysadm meeting unless you have a burning desire to do so.

And if you do have a burning desire to do so, you may want to have that checked out by a doctor.

Of course we are also quoting _2001: A Space Odyssey_ in the Jabber chat room.

I honestly think you ought to sit down calmly, take a stress pill, and think things over. 12:43:10 [sysadm]: Open the pod bay doors Hal!
