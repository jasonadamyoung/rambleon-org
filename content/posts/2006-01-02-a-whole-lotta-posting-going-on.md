I have imported the RSS feed from my old “binarypage” site at the [College of Engineering “People” Website][1] &#8211; and it actually worked reasonably well, other creating a bajillion categories I needed to clean up, and breaking every img link. You’ll notice a lot more content here, that I’ll be cleaning up and fixing the img links over the next who-knows-how-long.
