Sometimes in life, the title of your post isn’t going to have anything to do with the content. Sometimes, even in the era of the wayback machine. You re-read. And you self-edit. No words, certainly none of mine, in a moment of passionate expression could accurately capture the underlying desire for any project to be the best it can be. To model the best of the best. When you already have a history for speaking out and it didn’t work before &#8211; No matter how stubborn you are, you probably have to re-evaluate the expression.

Rudyard Kipling writes to “trust yourself when all men doubt you, but make allowance for the doubting too”

That certainly should be taken to heart all the way around. Starting with me.
