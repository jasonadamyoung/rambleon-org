Cool, it [looks like thereâ€™s an update to mysql in RHEL5v4][1] (to version [5.0.77][2] )

That means [this bug][3] is about to get fixed. I [wasted a bit too much of my life][4] on that bug last year.

p.s. 5077 sounded awfully familiar &#8211; but after double-checking, it was not the [unit number for the famous fictional MASH unit][5]. Whew.
