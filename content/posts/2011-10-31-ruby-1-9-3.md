Hooray — [Ruby 1.9.3][1] is out.

So inquiring minds (at least my inquiring mind) wanted to know — does it really help with the [rake][2] issues related to the ruby require code?

Yes.

<div class="highlighter-rouge">
  <pre class="highlight"><code>$ rvm get head$ rvm install 1.9.3$ rvm use 1.9.3@exrails31 --create$ gem install bundler$ cd project; bundle install</code></pre>
</div>

Results of a time rails console with immediate exit with a patched 1.9.2 (it’s a little slower than my previous post due to additional gems we’ve put in our project):

<div class="highlighter-rouge">
  <pre class="highlight"><code>rubydev:learn (ruby-1.9.2@exrails31)$ time rails consoleexitLoading development environment (Rails 3.1.1)&gt;&gt; exit    real	0m13.684suser	0m12.257ssys	0m1.452s</code></pre>
</div>

In Ruby 1.9.3:

<div class="highlighter-rouge">
  <pre class="highlight"><code>rubydev:learn (ruby-1.9.3@exrails31)$ time rails consoleexit/Users/jayoung/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p0@exrails31/gems/activesupport-3.1.1/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:240:in `block in require': iconv will be deprecated in the future, use String#encode instead.Loading development environment (Rails 3.1.1)&gt;&gt; exit    real	0m10.803suser	0m10.020ssys	0m0.777s</code></pre>
</div>

[Here’s a mention of the deprecation warning.][3] — but [I’m not sure it’s reported yet][4] (I honestly have a little trouble following the rails issues).

I’m personally still trying to get my app started — going to have to install [my own rails_config for a few days][5] until a new gem is released, so I’m not all sure what else might be a problem in 1.9.3 yet. But that will all work out, and I’ll take the three seconds!

[Update: everything’s working in our [current under-development app][6] with my own rails_config, and I’m not sure the iconv error is a rails issue as I trace through things]

[Update 2: The deprecation warning is coming from [css_parser][7] which is required by inline-style which [we have forked][8] in order to provide specific functionality we apparently need to reference an external mobile stylesheet but still convert inline styles.]

[Update 3: if you are landing on this post from search for the iconv error — you’ve got something requiring it in your app — see [this stack overflow post][9]]
