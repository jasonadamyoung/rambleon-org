I just upgraded my iTunes purchased songs to the DRM-free versions.

After a bumpy start in downloading them with lots of ridiculously obscure errors — it finally went off without a hitch.

Of course, the only ones that I had purchased that are now DRM Free, were an album from the [Blind Boys of Alabama][1] and an album from [KT Tunstall][2] (and a song from [Keith Urban][3] that the brown-eyed girl and I used in our Wedding reception) — but hey, it’s a start.

And I bought the [Corinne Bailey Rae][4] album — dude, 18 DRM-free songs for $9.99.

And the song “Up on Cripple Creek” from [The Band][5] (I already have “The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down” in mp3)

And I’m currently browsing all the country albums — and being very tempted to buy one from [The Highwaymen][6] and there’s Merle, and Willie and…

Somebody please stop me now before I buy “Okie from Muskogee”
