I hadn’t posted this yet, because, well, it really wasn’t germane to whatever boot camp and other silliness I’ve been complaining about.

But [I asked][1] Rogers Cadenhead about his continued work with the RSS Board and [he answered][2]. I really liked the answer.

And it’s probably time to switch this site to have an Atom 1.0 feed, if not from [wordpress themselves][3], (no, I’m not sure [I understand][4] either) — then from [Ben de Groot][5]. [Invalid or not.][6] it’s time to put my own blog where my mouth is (and the tentative-for-now eXtension blogs too).

(and the Mediawiki sites, but that’s another issue).

(p.s. no, I haven’t done it yet, and knowing me it’ll be a few weeks before I do, so much for coding the talk, or whatever)
