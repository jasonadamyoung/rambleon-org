I’m trying to clear out my podunk .Mac website, and pulled over my horrendous collection of bad parody songs I’ve written into WordPress pages tonight. So without further ado, or even a stray nonny-nonny &#8211; I give you Jay’s Greatest Hits:

  * [Don’t Let your babies grow up to be tech staff][1]
  * [With a Little Help from Depends][2]
  * [Bye, Bye, Oatmeal Creme Pie][3]
  * [They Don’t Do the HokeyPokey No more][4]
  * [Twelve Days of User Support][5]
