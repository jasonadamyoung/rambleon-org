10 years ago today I came back to NC State University, 9 months after my college graduation. I had quit my job at CompuCom a month prior — even breaking a training contact — it was one of those things that I ethically felt at the time I had to do. That’s another story for another day though.

I came back for a whole host of reasons, personal and professional. I guess what I wanted most of all was to find a place that I could learn from those that I thought were the best at what they did. That I could find a place to cast down my bucket. That I could find a place where Information Technology and education were a strategic role, not a servant one (notice I didn’t say “service”, “service” and “servant” are two completely different things). That I could make a difference. That’s really what I’ve always wanted most.

At times I’ve found that. But most days I’m still seeking it. IT is a tough place to be. University IT doubly so. 10 is pretty old in Internet Years. But a lot younger than a lot of folks I know. The real question is, does the potential for those things I looked forward to 10 years still exist?

> You see, most blokes, you know, will be playing at ten. You’re on ten here, all the way up, all the way up, all the way up, you’re on ten on your guitar. Where can you go from there? Where?

It will be interesting to see if these actually go to eleven.
