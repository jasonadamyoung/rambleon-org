Andrew Sullivan’s blog linked to this earlier today &#8211; and as if it wasn’t important to get the word out about what is going on in Egypt &#8211; what do we have for the news video? A copyright takedown.

Which is why [this development from Al Jazeera][2] is just great, amazing, and awesome for getting information out there.

People idly wonder about IP restrictions and our insane U.S. copyright policies and their impact on innovation &#8211; and the average Joe probably could care less.

I think this piece underscores those copyright policies and their impact on _freedom_.
