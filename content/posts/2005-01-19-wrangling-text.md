So I’m giving [TextWrangler][1] a spin this morning while working on [EWE][2].

I had been using [jEdit][3] for the last year or so &#8211; and was happy with it &#8211; jEdit is pretty fast for a java application, but a native app is still usually just “snappier” &#8211; and textwrangler is. I think I’m on the path to switching

I usually stay with editor defaults &#8211; largely because I change enough that I never really become profficient with them &#8211; but certain things had to change from the very beginning:

  * Default font for editing changed from Monaco,10pt to [BitStream Vera Mono, 12pt][4] (12pt. == I must be getting old)
  * Set the “save backup files” setting (I wish it had an autosave, I haven’t really found one yet &#8211; but I haven’t looked closely either)
  * TextWrangler can save an file’s “state” (window positions, font settings, etc.) &#8211; I turned off the “honor font settings” part &#8211; because it was driving me nuts that the Monaco font setting was sticking for certain files (there really should be a “strip the current state” option, I couldn’t find one)
  * I checked the “Balance while Typing” option &#8211; because I’m always leaving off a ‘)’ or a ‘}’ while coding in PHP and Perl. Interestingly, the “unmatched }’ notifications from textwrangler seem to be shipped off to [QuickSilver][5]
  * I checked the “Show Line numbers” option (a must), and the show cursor position, and show current function options

Right now, I only wish it would remember that I did a multi-file search last, and would automatically enter the highlighted term in the serach field. I also want to dock the search windows. I’ll get used to that though.

Kudos to BareBones. (now watch TextWrangler become a pay-for application again two years from now).
