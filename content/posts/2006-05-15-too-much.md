There is just too much to keep track of in my job.

This post brought to you by the [Planet aggregator][1] (particularly its use for [Apache][2] and [Jabber][3]), the [VMWare ESX][4] book I picked up at the bookstore today, my attempts to find Subversion 1.3.x RPMs for Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 4, kickstart configurations, and failed attempts at making the OS X VPN service work, while also trying to ascertain the current state of the Cell-phone service providers and their data plans for monitoring/notification purposes. Oh, and DNS planning too.

Way too much.
