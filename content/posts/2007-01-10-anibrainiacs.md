I’m not surprised in the slightest. What I’ve found in 10 years of working in higher education is that while I’ve been around brilliant people, people that have the ability to change the world &#8211; and sometimes have &#8211; that for many of them “better educated” most certainly does not equate to continually exploring, problem-solving, and actually using the cognitive parts of their brains.
