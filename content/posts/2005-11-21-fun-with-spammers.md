Dear Student,

I would like to offer you an exciting and well-paid job opportunity available to students from North Carolina State University. Every year we recruit reliable and self-motivated young people to participate in research projects for prestigious local and international companies.

You can earn from $650 to $850 per week by saying what you think. You will participate in online surveys, focus groups, and product/service evaluations. Get rewarded for your time and efforts.

This job is easy and rewarding. All you need is a computer, Internet connection, and good English skills. You will be free to decide from the comfort of your home when to work, how much to work, and which assignments to take. If you like the job, you can keep it as long as you want!

To become part of the research team, please write back and I will be happy to send you more information.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Sincerely,

Prof. Linda Johnson, Ph.D.

Hi Dr. Johnson!

I’m really interested in your job opportunity. My tiny little brother Timmy really, really, wants a “Knows Your Name Elmo” for christmas — and I’m not sure that’s going to happen. My Dad, Bob, got laid off from accounting firm last year, and know he’s working part-time as a clerk and is struggling to pay Timmy’s medical bills (Timmy has a congenital leg defect). My mom is a truck driver, and she’s been hit real hard by the increases in gas prices. And with me in college…, well it’s been a tough year for my family. I know I’m just going on and on. But I could really use the money, and I’m very motivated, and reliable. The idea of being able to do this from my dorm and computer is very appealing, and the fact that it’s a research team will help my chances of getting into grad school I bet.

I’m a little concerned though, I tried visiting ‘thbglobal.com’ and there’s no web site there. You also didn’t mention where you were a professor at. Are you a professor at a NC school? Is there an opportunity to get any kind of course credit with your research?

Thank you! I look forward to hearing from you!
