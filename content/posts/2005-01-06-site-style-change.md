Due to some required changes in the ewe display code, both [The binarypage weblog][1] and the [the default wiki][2] have a temporary style change.

This style, titled “simple” was [created by Greg Brown][3] originally for use at our internal ITECS/Helpdesk site. Thanks to Greg for the temporary use of his eweStyle.
