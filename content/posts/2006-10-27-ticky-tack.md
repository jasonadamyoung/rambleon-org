The “phrase” ticky-tack is getting pretty good play recently in our group at work. I’m pretty sure I managed to introduce it at some point a few months ago about something-or-other request we were dealing with.

Apparently James has now started using it and wondered where the heck I got it from.

And I hadn’t the slightest idea.

Until, thanks to Wikipedia(*) — the root of the phrase is from the late sportscaster [Chick Hearn][1]. I’m sure that Mr. Hearn’s phrase made its way through sportscasting, and to friends of mine and to me, for me to subvert to the fun and exciting world of technology.

(* it’s not all [wikiality][2] )
