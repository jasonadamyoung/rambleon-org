From [CU-Boulder][1] via  [Roland Piquepaille][2]

Roland has a choice pull quote:

> It is clear that the brain is much more like a social network than a digital computer, with learning, memory and processing all being performed locally through graded communication between interconnected neurons. These neurons build up strong, complex “relationships” over a long period of time; a neuron buried deep in the brain can only function by learning which of the other neurons it can trust to convey useful information.

In contrast, a digital computer functions like the post office, routing arbitrary symbolic packages between passive memory structures through a centralized processing unit, without consideration for the contents of these packages.

Obligatory Commentary:

On a macro-scale &#8211; I’d say there’s a lot of implication in this for the design of software systems on top of digital computers. When you build _arbitrary_ structure on top of data, without consideration for what that data is &#8211; you completely go against how our brains are oriented to interact with data.
