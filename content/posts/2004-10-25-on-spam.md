My self-selected quote from an email to a University mailing list:

> _I think at some point we have to depend on the recipients to use his/her  
> most powerful computer of all, and apply the same critical thinking and  
> reasoning skills that we demand of them in their University pursuits to  
> determine the legitimacy of online communication._

I am beginning to believe more and more and more that people turn their brains off when using the computer. Why is that?
