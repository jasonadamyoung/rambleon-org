President-elect Obama:

> To all those who have wondered if America’s beacon still burns as bright &#8211; tonight we proved once more that the true strength of our nation comes not from the might of our arms or the scale of our wealth, but from the enduring power of our ideals: democracy, liberty, opportunity, and unyielding hope.

That’s my America.
