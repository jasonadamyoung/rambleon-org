Last night, when I was at the Quicken site looking at possible upgrades to Quicken 2006 for the Macintosh &#8211; either Quicken 2007 for Macintosh or Quicken 2008 for Windows (running under VMWare) &#8211; the prices were $59.99 (Macintosh) and $39.99 (Windows/Deluxe)

Today they are $69.99 and $59.99.

That might have made the decision for me &#8211; I’ll certainly spend more than that in labor time to import/cleanup/re-enter my data into [iBank][1] or go to [Wesabe][2].

But ad-hoc discount removal on a moment’s notice? Ridiculous.

([edited] okay, they are well within their rights to do so, it’s business &#8211; but why not post some dates and things? and why would the prices change between tuesday night and wednesday? it just seems like it’s completely arbitrary)
