It’s been awhile, hasn’t it?

A lot of life has happened in the last few months. After four years of searching, we finally found a home that we liked &#8211; on the western side of the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill “Triangle” area. Five acres of mostly trees on a river just north of Hillsborough, N.C.

And along with that new home is a new virtual home: <http://littleriverview.org> (currently an Apache redirect to a wordpress.com blog at http://words.littleriverview.org).

I would imagine that much of has made rambleon.org what is it is, rambly meandering posts about Life, the Universe, and Everything, and almost all of the photography will find its way there, basically most of what made rambleon.org, well, rambly.

The technology posts? I’m not so sure. There’s a lot of that part of my life that’s been in transition as well, and I’d imagine there’s a lot more transition to come in the next few months (not the part of being a technologist, like Shakespeare, that’s not of an age, but for all time with me).

I’m not sure of the future of rambleon.org, but if you’ve made this far with me, you probably can best find me in [twitter][2] or [Github][3]

For now, so long and thanks for all the fish.
