So after reading [a post by James Walker][1] on the subject. I decided to give the [MSN Beta Search][2] a spin.

[Search for Jason Young][3] put me fourth in the list. And I think “wow, that’s higher than I’ve ever seen Google do that” &#8211; and was all ready to write up a post about getting my ego stroked by Microsoft.

Well, when I [searched Google for Jason Young][4]. I came up **second** in the list.

Something is seriously wrong in the world. I thought for a moment that Google and MSN both skewed results to similar domains of where you are coming from (which wouldn’t be a bad algorithm by the way, we use Google to pretty find anything on the NCSU sites already) &#8211; but [Billy][5] tried it via RDP to his machine at home &#8211; and I was second there too.

Thankfully Rob reported that I’m not even in the 190 results that [Ask Jeeves][6] returns. So all is right with the world again.

(Which all makes me wonder if Google (and MSN Search) skew results toward .edu sites)

**[Update]:** I bet it was the fact that [Brad][7] linked to me. He’s got a popular blog. I wonder if that means I should stop picking on Microsoft.
