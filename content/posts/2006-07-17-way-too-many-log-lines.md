Too damn many log lines_

Finally using [awstats][1] to process the last several months of log files. 2,076,227 log lines for a few dozen low-traffic (thankfully) websites from around March to prior to yesterday. Even with my own private DNS server running on the same box as the update script, itâ€™s about 30 lines a second. I think it should be done in 19 hours ðŸ™‚
