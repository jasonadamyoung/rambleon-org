[This article in the Washington Post][1] might be one of the most interesting stories Iâ€™ve read in quite some time.

> On that Friday in January, those private questions would be answered in an unusually public way. No one knew it, but the fiddler standing against a bare wall outside the Metro in an indoor arcade at the top of the escalators was one of the finest classical musicians in the world, playing some of the most elegant music ever written on one of the most valuable violins ever made.

Highly recommended reading.
