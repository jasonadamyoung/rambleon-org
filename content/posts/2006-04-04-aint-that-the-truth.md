I read [this CNet article][1] from Linux World about the [OLPC][2] project with great interest. There’s lots of little tidbits in it about the bloatedness of Linux and Windows, and Microsoft dissing the project, even when they are working on CE versions that could work with the OLPC specs — and a very interesting prognostication about mesh networks that I personally think is right on the money.

The quote that I found most interesting:

> Once children have the laptops, they’ll teach themselves, he predicted, making teacher training beside the point. “Teachers teach the kids? Give me a break,” he said. “Give any kid an electronic game and the first thing they do is throw away the manual and the second thing they do is use it.”

I would absolutely love to find a way to encourage the adults (nee, the teachers and the faculty) to do that.
