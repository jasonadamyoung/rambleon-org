Last night, I had dinner with Billy and Mandy &#8211; and we talked about various things &#8211; including work (Billy took my old job as the [ITECS][1] Systems Manager). Billy said something pretty enlightening for me &#8211; while I was talking about how I’m a little less stressed that I’m not managing 5 people anymore and how, while I need to hire someone to help with the Systems work in eXtension &#8211; something I’ve been pretty hesitant to do thus far.

He said:

_“You really never wanted to be a manager. It was more like you wanted to be a mentor.”_

You know, I think that’s pretty dead on. I’m really terrible at the directive forms of managing. “Do this. Then do that. This is due then. That is due then+2 Here’s A, B, C, D, E.” I’m very much more the “Here’s where we are going” “This is how we might get there” “Here’s what I’ve done before in this almost-similar situation” “Here’s something that might or might not pop up around the middle from A to E and here’s something else to think about”

So, if I’m going to do this mentoring thing, I have to stop complaining so much 🙂 Even if it provides hours of entertainment for Billy and others.
