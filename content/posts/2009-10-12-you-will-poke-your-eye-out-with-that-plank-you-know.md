I love to make fun of Microsoft, but not about everything. Elaborating on my [one-forty on the Microsoft/Danger data debacle][1] &#8211; if you are a technologist, you might want to actually have had to do systems administration and walk a few hundred operating system installs in their shoes before you start pointing fingers.

If you are a systems administrator? You better check your own backups right now, then you can point.

And if you are a pundit? _It doesn’t have a damn thing to do with “the cloud”_ &#8211; It _is_ partially about services that don’t let you get your data out. But that could be WordPerfect as much as it could be “the cloud”
