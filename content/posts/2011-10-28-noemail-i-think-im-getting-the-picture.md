Proof that some (all?) work email is bad for you. (with data!)

So right before I got on the elliptical machine yesterday I read a work email about a particularly “challenging” piece of software we have in place.

This is what my heartrate looks like after said work email compared to the last two previous workouts

New rule, no work email before workouts.

Colophon: this comes from opening my iPod’s Nike+ data ( it’s in iPod_Control/Device/Trainer/Workouts/Empeds/heartrateonly for heart rate workouts ) for each workout, copying it to a text file — turning the comma delimited data into line-by-line data and pasting each workout’s data into the fantastic [OmniGraphSketcher][2] — which plots each data set independently as you paste each in.
