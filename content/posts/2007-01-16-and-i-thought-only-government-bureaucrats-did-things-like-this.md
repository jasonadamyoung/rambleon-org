Nope, corporate bureaucrats do too.

Via iLounge [Apple’s charging $5 for an 802.11n “enabler”][1]

Oh, and get this, the company that brought you the lovely ridiculously persistent QuickTime nag screens to get you to upgrade to QuickTime Pro &#8211; blames this charge on _“Accounting Rules”_

> “Because of the Act [Sarbanes-Oxley], the company believes that if it sells a product, then later adds a feature to that product, it can be held liable for improper accounting if it recognizes revenue from the product at the time of sale, given that it hasn’t finished delivering the product at that point.”

So they have to charge for new “features.” Good Grief.
