…to learn how to use [Screen][1] effectively.

So that [Network events without times associated with them][2] that occur during your script execution that has to be done after hours won’t kill you scripts.

Rule #1 of System Administration: when writing error checking in your scripts, never think to yourself — “by jove, I think I have it! All that could cause me a problem now is a network interruption”. Because you’ll get a network interruption.

That, and saying “by jove” is passe.

**[update]** It didn’t have a time on it on Monday :-).
