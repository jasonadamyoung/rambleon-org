So last night I had a dream that I left the University and took a job with Microsoft.

Writing Java.

The dream was pretty detailed, I was walking around some kind of Queen Anne-style house — which apparently was the team’s meeting place — and in what would be the parlor in some overstuffed chairs I started quizzing the person showing me around (who was dressed in jeans and a white shirt with black tie, like a journeyman for the Best Buy “Geek Squad”) about their build process, who exactly said “go” for product releases, whether or not Visual Studio, or dev studio, or whatever Microsoft calls their dev product today actually did Java syntax or not.

It was weird. And just… wrong… Microsoft and Java. It was like being hired to build the Matrix for Vader. Or for Voldermort.
