Or maybe just small firms that go viral.

Check out [this commercial][1] from the Cary, NC team of [5pointproduction][2] (warning way too much non-direct linkable flash).

And [I love the blog][3]

It’s talent + access to pro-quality tools that’s getting easier and easier + web-based resources that make it easy to get yourself out there (but only if you are willing to **try** and **learn** those resources) + more talent.

Wow, I’m actually positive about the future of content generation again.
