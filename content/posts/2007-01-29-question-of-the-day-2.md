So, if a work created by an officer or employee of the United States Government that’s part of the person’s official duties (see also [Cornell Law][1]) — is [Public Domain][2]…

Then why on earth isn’t it the same for officers and employees of states, and state and federal funded institutions that are created as part of that person’s official duties?

Or at the very least, under the auspices of a derivable, share-alike license?

Inquiring minds really want to know.
