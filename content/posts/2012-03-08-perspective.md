![Sunrise over Savannah][1]

Four weeks ago, I [wrote][2] about starting a new job for the first time in 15 years.

Last friday, I resigned.

The company was Rails Machine, a web operations company based in Savannah with an orientation toward managing Ruby on Rails applications. I have a tremendous amount of respect and appreciation for what the people there do, how they treat their customers, and the level of talent and problem-solving skill in the team. They live and breathe web operations.

For me, at the end of the day, it just wasn’t the right fit or the right place. And I don’t feel I was the right person for Rails Machine. I don’t know how fair it is to say that after just four weeks. I’m not sure any new, challenging role is the right fit after four weeks. But sometimes you just know about the place. Staying wasn’t going to be right for me, or my family or the people at RailsMachine.

I am looking forward to some upcoming opportunities, but for now, I’m taking the break that I should have taken prior to starting four weeks ago. I’m learning some new things, paying down some technical debt, working on the honeydo list, taking walks with the dogs, and gaining some perspective.
