The quote about the quote of the day [from Bob Plankers][1]

> How many times a week do you work around shortcuts, where the original person saved a few minutes but cost weeks of time later?

My entire job seems to be centered on predicting and avoiding (or sometimes laying the foundation for) cascade effects.
