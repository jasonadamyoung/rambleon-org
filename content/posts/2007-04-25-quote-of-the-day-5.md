From [Keith Whitney][1]

> “Few things retain their coolness across generations.”

I had a Macintosh Plus at my co-op job at GTE Government Systems — complete with beer can mouse. When I managed to finagle myself a leftover IIci — that was the greatest day ever.

My first personal Macintosh was a 6100/AV — then I fell off the bandwagon with a bunch of NT-based PC’s for years.

This post would be tagged (if I had tags) as “uphillbothwaysinthesnow”
