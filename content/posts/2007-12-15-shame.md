I have a good friend serving as an Army Chaplain in Afghanistan. I dropped him a note the other day to tell him about my wife and I [bringing a second pup home][1] and [linking to the story of it][2].

His “government computer” in the office? It blocks access to Flickr apparently (and maybe rambleon.org, he wasn’t clear on that).

The military blocks Flickr. Absurd.

It might not be a blanket policy in theater. It just might be that office, or that computer. Whatever it is, the IT people that manage that computer should be absolutely ashamed of themselves.
