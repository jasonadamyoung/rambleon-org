I’m so tired of writing crappily

Today was using “their” instead of “there”

I certainly know the difference, but when I’m using lots of references to “their content” I’ll end up writing “content their”

and it’s sooooo glaringly bad when I go back and read it after I’ve already sent it.

sigh. I should just focus on the servers and never ever write another email again.
