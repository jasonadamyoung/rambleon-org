12 years later &#8211; O.J. is back in the news.

Henceforth, I shall resolve that this blog will be a “No O.J. None of the Time” blog.

But it gives me great joy to be able to [resurrect 12 year-old newspaper columns][1] that are basically just as relevant today as then.

As I was remarking to a former co-worker today, where I was telling him he could keep me in the database if it meant he could blame me for the software they were still running, whereupon I would blame other former co-workers for not implementing my specs right, whereupon they’d blame him for extending it in the wrong way &#8211; it’s part of the natural way of life &#8211; “The Circle of Blame”

Hakuna Blametata.
