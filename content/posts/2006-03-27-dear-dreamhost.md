You know, when I tell you that your load averages on the server where my podunk wordpress sites are is consistently too high, and pointing out the output from ‘w’ where it was > 9 (and didn’t show you where it reached 14) &#8211; and how that’s causing problems, and how the wordpress “php timestamps” on things are 6-7 times higher than sites I run at work? And how I think you oversold the service, but at least find the problem user(s) causing the astronomical load averages and tell them to stop?

Yeah, please don’t tell me to run traceroute and give you the output from that.

Readers of my blog might have noticed a hiccup today while I shifted hosting providers from dreamhost to site5.com.

(and a repost of this article because I forgot to dump it out of the db at dreamhost after I posted it)
