Coming this thursday:

_In the blue corner:_

### Dentist Appointment {#dentist-appointment}

scheduled last August for what became the same time period as…

_In the red corner:_

### All-Staff Meeting {#all-staff-meeting}

I mean, can you really ask for a better decision for the week? 🙂

Proving that I am indeed, a glutton for all things punishable, I rescheduled the dentist appointment for the afternoon.

We’ve already named one project “Seymour” — maybe the next one will be named [Orin Scrivello, DDS][1] 😉
