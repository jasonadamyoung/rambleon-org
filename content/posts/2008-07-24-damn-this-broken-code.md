_what can I say?  I’ve been coding straight for a few weeks now, some of these things, just, happen, it was time some programming joined [the pantheon of greatest hits][1]_

_Apologies to Marcus Hummon, Jeff Hanna, and Bobby Boyd_

_sing along with the [Rascal Flatts version of the real song][2]_

I set out to fix this crap many hours ago Hoping I would find the bugs within this broken code Segfaulted a time or two Had a Lowenbrau, kept writing glue Started to see with every line my coding career was through

Every long stack trace showing corrupted args Others getting fail whales, leaving my boss in horror Pointing me on my way, this is so fubar’d This much I know is true God damn this broken code My coding career is through

(Yes it is)

I think about the years I spent on this pile of poo My code is channeling Microsoft, even the screen is blue It ran before, I don’t understand I want to blame the sysadmin It’s all part of a conspiracy that is coming true

Every long stack trace showing corrupted args Others getting fail whales, leaving my boss in horror Pointing me on my way, this is so fubar’d This much I know is true God damn this broken code My coding career is through
