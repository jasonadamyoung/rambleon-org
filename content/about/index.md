My name is Jason Adam Young, I build things for the web and help others to do the same and this is my mostly dormant blog. Sometimes it’s about computing and technology, most days it’s just a bunch of rambly posts and photos of my cat and memories of my dogs.
### Greatest Hits

If you are looking for my personal, work, and overall philosophy &#8211; I recommend checking out:

  * [The Wedgebuster][4] and [Head In The Clouds][5]: My absolute favorites.
  * [What did it for you][6]: Early experiences in technology that got me where I am today
  * [Operator, can you help me place this call][7]: Workplace communication
  * [There’s just life][8]: there’s no “real life” and “online life” &#8211; there’s just life
  * [Why ask why?][9]: Most important question you can ask.
  * [The “build it” myth][10]: Web sites have nothing to do with “Field of Dreams”
  * [To deploy or not deploy][12]: when the going gets rough, the rough rewrite Shakespeare
  * [I fully admit that I write long emails][13]
